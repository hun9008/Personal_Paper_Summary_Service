## 1 Introduction

Here is a summarized version of the paper without modifiers, using paragraphs instead of markdown, and applying LaTeX to equations:

The increasing deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) across various applications has raised concerns about their privacy implications. Many DNNs are trained on private and sensitive datasets, making them vulnerable to Model Inversion (MI) attacks. In MI attacks, adversaries seek to reconstruct private training samples by exploiting vulnerabilities in the model. 
Recently, there is an increasing interest to study MI and understand its feasibility and extent of reconstructing private training samples from DNNs. However, previous studies have overlooked DNN architecture, and there is a lack of study to understand how DNN architecture designs affect MI. 
To address this research gap, we conduct the first study to understand how DNN architecture designs affect MI. We focus on skip connections, a fundamental network design that facilitates the training of very deep neural networks. Skip connections mitigate the vanishing gradient problem during the training stage. However, many state-of-the-art (SOTA) MI attacks require the use of gradients to guide the reconstruction of private training samples during the inversion stage. 
Our hypothesis is that skip connections facilitate the flowing of gradients during inversion, reinforcing MI attacks and posing a considerable vulnerability to data privacy in DNNs. To validate our hypothesis, we carefully design experiments to single out the effect of skip connections on MI attack performance. Our extensive experiments on SOTA networks against SOTA MI attacks show that skip connections in the last stage have the most significant effect on MI attacks. 
To mitigate the MI vulnerability caused by skip connections, we analyze RepVGG, an established reparameterization technique. However, our analysis shows that RepVGG could not mitigate the vulnerability. Therefore, we propose MI-resilient architecture designs based on our own findings. Specifically, as we find that the last stage's skip connections have the most significant effect on MI, we propose Removal of Last Stage Skip-Connection (RoLSS) as an MI-resilient architecture design. 
Our contributions are: Based on our findings, we propose MI resilient architecture designs for the first time, including: Removal of Last Stage Skip-Connection (RoLSS), Skip-Connection Scaling Factor (SSF) and Two-Stage Training Scheme (TTS). Extensive experiments show that our MI-resilient architectures can outperform SOTA defense methods in MI robustness.

**Summary**

The concept of Model Inversion (MI) was initially studied by Fredrikson et al., who demonstrated that adversaries could extract genomic and demographic information about patients from a medical imaging model using machine learning. Several studies have been conducted to understand the feasibility and extent of reconstructing private training samples from Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, there is a lack of study on understanding the effect of DNN architecture design on MI. 
<font color='red'>The key finding of our work</font> is that skip connections, which are recognized as an effective approach to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem, actually reinforce Model Inversion attacks. This differs significantly from existing works that observed that skip connections aid adversarial robustness. 
In particular, for MI attacks, the goal is to extract sensitive training data information from ML models, rather than deceive the model into making incorrect predictions or implant malicious functionality in the model. Our work is the first to study the implications of skip connection on data privacy of ML models through the MI attacks. 
<font color='red'>The use of skip connections facilitates gradient backpropagation during MI attacks and reinforces MI</font>, thereby compromising data privacy. This is demonstrated using a ResNet-like architecture, where the gradient backpropagates across a ResNet block as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_i} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z_{i+1}} + \frac{\partial g_i}{\partial z_i}\cdot\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_{i+1}}
$$

where $g_i$ is the residual module comprising multiple convolutions. 
<font color='red'>The first gradient component, $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_{i+1}}$, enabled by the skip connection, enhances backpropagation and reinforces MI attacks</font>.

## 3.2 Stage-wise skip connection removal study

Here is a summarized version of the paper without markdown and with LaTeX formatting:

The effect of skip connections on Model Inversion (MI) attacks was investigated. The study used ResNet-101 and DenseNet-121 as target models, attacked using the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) MI attack method PPA. 
**<font color='red'>Our findings reveal that architectures with fewer skip connections impede MI attacks</font>**, leading to a decrease in MI attack accuracy. The removal of skip connections from various stages of the architecture was studied, and it was found that **<font color='red'>removing skip connections in the last stage results in the most degradation in MI attack accuracy</font>**. 
The study also showed that removing skip connections leads to MI optimization converging with more false positives. This is because, without skip connections, latent variables with high likelihood can still be identified by the MI adversary, but many of these variables are false positives. 
Mathematically, this can be represented as:

**<font color='red'>P(y|G(w)) = 1</font>**, where y is the target ID and G(w) is the generator network. 
The likelihood distribution of latent variables with skip connections removed was found to be similar to that of the full model, but the attack accuracy was significantly lower. This suggests that, without skip connections, the gradients lead MI adversaries to exploit many w∗ that do not correspond to images resembling private data. 
**<font color='red'>Therefore, our results imply that architectures with fewer skip connections are more resistant to MI attacks</font>**.

## 3.3 Extensive validation of the MI vulnerability of skip connections

**Summary**

We conducted extensive experiments to further validate the impact of skip connections to model inversion attacks (MI attacks). We used various architectures and MI attacks on different datasets, including Facescrub, CelebA, and Stanford Dogs. 
In our study, we found that removing skip connections in the last stage results in a consistent and notable reduction in attack accuracy across all SOTA MI attacks. This includes a 10% to 15% drop for additive skip connections (e.g., ResNet-34/50/152/EfficientNet-B0) and a 30% to 35% drop for concatenative skip connections (e.g., DenseNet-161/169/201). 
These results further validate our findings in Sec. 3 that skip connections reinforce MI attacks. We consistently observed significant drops in MI attack accuracy, ranging from 10% to 35%. 
<font color='red'>Our study demonstrates the vulnerability of skip connections to model inversion attacks</font>, and <font color='red'>the removal of last stage skip-connections (RoLSS) can significantly reduce attack accuracy</font>. These findings have important implications for ensuring the security and integrity of machine learning models.

## vulnerability to MI

**Summary**

We investigate the vulnerability of RepVGG's inference-time architecture to model inversion (MI) attacks. We find that despite removing skip connections in the inference-time architecture, it remains as vulnerable to MI attacks as the training-time architecture. This is because the gradients in the inference-time architecture still include components from the skip connection branches, even though they are absent during inference. 
<font color='red'>Removing skip connections in the inference-time architecture does not help mitigate vulnerability to MI attacks</font>. Our results are consistent across different RepVGG architectures and datasets. We conclude that the structural re-parameterization approach used by RepVGG is insufficient to protect against MI attacks. 
**Equations**

Let $\mathbf{x}$ be the input image, $\mathbf{y}$ be the output of the inference-time architecture, and $\nabla_\mathbf{x} \mathbf{y}$ be the gradient of the output with respect to the input. We can represent the gradients in the inference-time architecture as:

$$
\nabla_\mathbf{x} \mathbf{y} = \nabla_\mathbf{x} \mathbf{\hat{y}} + \nabla_\mathbf{x} \mathbf{s},
$$

where $\mathbf{\hat{y}}$ is the output of the plain convolutional layer, and $\mathbf{s}$ represents the gradient components from the skip connection branch. 
Using LaTeX to typeset this equation:

$\nabla_\mathbf{x} \mathbf{y} = \nabla_\mathbf{x} \mathbf{\hat{y}} + \nabla_\mathbf{x} \mathbf{s}$

## Model Inversion Resilient Architecture Design

Here is a summarized version of the paper, written in paragraphs and applying LaTeX for equations, with important sentences highlighted in red:

Our findings reveal that skip-connections reinforce model inversion (MI) attacks, while existing techniques are insufficient to mitigate this vulnerability. To bridge this gap, we propose novel architecture designs that improve MI robustness: Removal of Last Stage Skip-Connection (RoLSS), Skip-Connection Scaling Factor (SSF), and Two-stage Training Scheme (TTS). These proposals are remarkably simple and maintain the same training procedure as the original model. 
The key benefit of RoLSS is that it involves no additional hyperparameters, making it easily applicable to various architectures. In contrast, the state-of-the-art MI defense BiDO requires an extensive grid search for each architecture. Our investigation reveals that removing skip connections in the last stage yields significant degradation in MI attack accuracy, suggesting a promising approach to improve MI robustness from an architectural perspective. 
The results consistently show that removing the skip connections in the last stage (i.e., RoLSS) can improve the MI robustness. Notably, our simple RoLSS achieves highly competitive MI robustness compared to the state-of-the-art MI defense BiDO. For instance, with ResNet-101, our RoLSS improves model accuracy by <font color='red'>2.09%</font>, while the MI attack accuracy degrades by <font color='red'>8.49%</font>, resulting in superior MI robustness compared to BiDO. 
Here are the LaTeX equations for reference:

## 5.2 Skip-Connection Scaling Factor

We propose the Scale and Signal Factor (SSF) to improve the natural accuracy of the model while maintaining competitive Model Inversion (MI) robustness on top of Robust Lottery Ticket Selection Search (RoLSS). <font color='red'>The SSF generalizes the skip connection, where k = 1 corresponds to the original skip connection</font>, and degrades MI attack performance when gradients are limited with k < 1. We set k = 0.01 for all concatenative skip connection architectures and k = 0.2 for all additive skip connections in our experimental setups. 
Our SSF improves MI robustness beyond RoLSS and outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MI defense BiDO [40] across various architectures. <font color='red'>For DenseNet, SSF significantly aids in recovering model performance while still mitigating MI attacks</font>, resulting in much improved MI robustness. For example, with DenseNet-201, SSF only incurs a ∼1% drop in model accuracy while degrading MI attack accuracy by ∼12%. 
The key equation for SSF is:

$\boxed{z_{i+1} = g_i(z_i) + k \cdot z_i}$

where $0 \leq k \leq 1$ is the scale factor.

## 5.3 Two-stage Training Scheme (TTS)

Here is the summarized content without modifiers:

We introduce a Two-stage Training Scheme (TTS) to improve model accuracy while maintaining competitive Mutual Information (MI) robustness. TTS consists of two training stages: Stage 1: We train model <font color='red'>T</font> with full skip-connections architecture over M epochs, ensuring the reasonable convergence of θT with well-backpropagated gradients through the full skip connections architecture. Stage 2: We remove skip connections in the last stage to create a skip connection-removed architecture Tp, and continue to train θTp over N epochs. 
<font color='red'>Stage 1 serves as an initialization for θTp</font>, aiding the enhanced convergence of Tp. The pre-trained parameters serve as initialization for Tp. We build TTS on top of RoLSS and match the total training epochs of both stages to that of the original model. The results demonstrate that TTS outperforms the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) MI defense BiDO [40] while maintaining competitive MI robustness. 
<font color='red'>TTS improves model accuracy</font> while maintaining competitive MI robustness compared to RoLSS, achieving similar MI attack accuracy as BiDO but with comparable model accuracy to No Def. model in the ResNet-34 setup.

## 6 Conclusion

**Summary**

Our study investigates the impact of DNN architecture on the security of Machine Learning (MI) attacks. The results show that skip connections in DNNs enhance MI attacks, compromising data privacy. Specifically, we find that the skip connection in the last stage is the most critical for MI attacks. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that removing skip connections in the inference-time architecture does not mitigate MI vulnerabilities. 
<font color='red'>Our findings suggest that skip connections are a significant factor in making DNNs vulnerable to MI attacks.</font>

To address this issue, we propose three novel MI-resilient architecture designs: Removal of Last Stage Skip-Connection (RoLSS), Skip-Connection Scaling Factor (SSF), and Two-stage Training Scheme (TTS). These designs are simple to implement and achieve competitive MI robustness compared to State-of-the-Art (SOTA) MI defense. 
<font color='red'>Our proposed architectures demonstrate the potential for improving MI security.</font>

The key contributions of our study include:

* Analyzing the impact of skip connections on MI attacks
* Proposing three novel MI-resilient architecture designs

**Mathematical Formulation**

Let $x$ be the input to a DNN, and let $f(x)$ be the output. We can represent the DNN as a sequence of layers, each with its own set of weights and activations. 
\[ f(x) = \sigma(W_2 \cdot \sigma(W_1 \cdot x)) \]

where $\sigma$ is an activation function, and $W_1$, $W_2$ are weight matrices.

## 8 Skip Connection Removal Study on Vision Transformer

**Study on Vision Transformer Architectures**

Our investigation on Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures reveals that skip connections reinforce **<font color='red'>Model Inversion (MI) attacks</font>**. We conduct a study on vanilla ViT and MaxViT, observing consistent results with CNNs architectures. 
In our experiment, we employ the State-of-the-Art MI attack, PPA [43], using StyleGAN [28] as the prior distribution. The target classifier T is trained on private dataset Dpriv, while public dataset Dpub is used to extract prior information. We evaluate our results using natural accuracy (Acc) and Attack Accuracy (AttAcc). 
Our findings show that removing skip connections in ViTs leads to a **<font color='red'>significant drop in MI attack accuracy</font>** (∼30% in MaxViT 20), indicating that skip connections reinforce MI attacks. This result further validates our findings in the main manuscript. 
In particular, we note that in the MaxViT setup:

\begin{equation}
\text{Attack Accuracy} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbbm{1}_{\{y_i = 1\}}}{N}
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the number of samples, and $\mathbbm{1}_{\{y_i = 1\}}$ is an indicator function that equals 1 if the sample $i$ is correctly classified by the attack. 
Our results suggest that removing skip connections in ViTs leads to improved MI robustness, as depicted in Fig. 8. 
**Detailed Analysis and Additional Results for RepVGG**

## 9.1 Removing skip connection in inference-time architecture

**Summary**

The paper explores whether RepVGG's inference-time architecture can mitigate vulnerability to Membership Inference (MI) attacks by removing skip connections. Analytical and empirical analysis shows that the gradients in the inference-time architecture are the same as those in the training-time architecture, making it ineffective in mitigating MI attacks. 
**Key Findings**

The key findings of this paper are:

* The <font color='red'>outputs</font> of a TRepVGG block and an (cid:92) TRepVGG block are equal, i.e., fi(zi) = (cid:98) fi(zi). * The gradients in a (cid:92) TRepVGG block, ∂(cid:98) fi/∂zi, are the same as those in a TRepVGG block, ∂fi/∂zi. * Consequently, during MI attacks, the gradients in inference-time architecture, (cid:92) TRepVGG, are the same as those in training-time architecture TRepVGG. 
**Mathematical Equations**

The paper presents the following mathematical equations:

\[
zi+1 = fi(zi) = BN(zi ∗ W(3),µ(3),σ(3),γ(3),β(3)) + BN(zi ∗ W(1),µ(1),σ(1),γ(1),β(1)) + BN(zi,µ(0),σ(0),γ(0),β(0))
\]

\[
(cid:98) fi(zi) = zi ∗ (cid:99) W +(cid:98) b
\]

\[
(cid:99) W(k) = γ(k) σ(k)W(k)
\]

\[
(cid:100) b(k) = β(k) − µ(k)γ(k) σ(k)
\]

\[
(cid:98) fi(zi) = (cid:98) fi(zi) = zi ∗ (cid:99) W +(cid:98) b
\]

## 9.2 Additional results on other RepVGG architectures

**Summary**

The additional empirical results on RepVGG-A1/A2/B0/B1 are consistent with those in the main manuscript, showing that the inference-time architecture without skip connections is still vulnerable to Model Inversion (MI) attacks. The results indicate that removing skip connections does not improve the model's resistance to MI attacks. 
The experiments were conducted on two datasets: Facescrub and FFHQ, with the RepVGG-A1/A2/B0/B1 architectures achieving similar vulnerability to MI attacks as the training-time architecture. The evaluation metrics included natural accuracy (Acc), attack accuracy (AttAcc), and distance between reconstructed features and private training features computed using Evaluation Model δeval and FaceNet Model [41] δface. 
The findings suggest that **<font color='red'>the removal of skip connections does not necessarily improve the model's resistance to MI attacks</font>.**

Here is the summarized content:

**SSF on RoLSS**

We propose a novel method called SSF (Scale Factor) to improve the natural accuracy of the model while maintaining competitive Mutual Information (MI) robustness on top of RoLSS. **<font color='red'>The key idea is to generalize skip connections by introducing a scale factor 0 ≤ k ≤ 1, which adjusts the signal on the skip connection of the last stage.</font>**

**Application to Concatenative Skip Connections**

SSF is equally applicable to concatenative skip connections as in DenseNets. In particular, SSF can be applied to DenseBlocks where input features are concatenated with the output features before being fed into the next DenseBlock. 
**Mathematical Representation**

The scale factor is used to adjust the signal on the skip connection of the last stage, and the resulting equation is:
\[ zi+1 = \left[ zscale i , gi(z_i) \right] \]
where \(zscale i\) is a subset of \(zi\) including \(k \cdot n\) features from \(zi\), with \(n\) being the total number of features of \(zi\). 
**Impact on MI Robustness**

With \(k < 1\), gradients can be limited during Mutual Information attack, which could degrade MI.

To further improve the robustness of **<font color='red'>Model Interpretability (MI)</font>**, we combine our MI-resilient architectures with the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) MI defense, BiDO.

$$
 where $\mathbf{x}$ is the input data and $y$ is the corresponding label. The MI-resilient architectures are designed to enhance the robustness of the model, represented as $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$, against adversarial attacks:

$$

The impact of scale factor k on SSF (Scale Factor) is investigated through an ablation study <font color='red'>in terms of restoring natural accuracy and resilience to MI attacks</font>. As k increases, natural accuracy is more effectively restored. However, larger values of k also lead to a stronger reinforcement of Model Inversion (MI) attacks.

This approach can be easily extended to other stages to offer greater flexibility and control over the privacy-utility tradeoff. 
Our results show that RoLSS+ achieves a better privacy-utility trade-off than RoLSS <font color='red'>by further improving defense performance</font>. The proposed method, RoLSS, focuses on removing skip connections in the last stage only, which is critical to MI attacks based on our discovery. This approach can be easily extended to other stages to offer greater flexibility and control over the privacy-utility tradeoff. 
Here are the equations written in LaTeX:

Let $k$ be the scale factor, $\alpha$ be the accuracy of the model, and $\beta$ be the resilience of the model to MI attacks. Then,
\[ \alpha(k) = f(k) \]
where $f$ is a function that represents the relationship between $k$ and $\alpha$. Similarly,

Here is a summarized version of the content without using # and * and applying LaTeX to equations:

The model inversion study on architectures without skip connections shows that attack accuracy for VGG is significantly lower compared to architectures with skip connections. The results are consistent with our observation that skip connections reinforce MI attack, which is <font color='red'>a key finding</font>. 

In this section, we provide additional details on the Stage-wise Skip Connection Removal Study, specifically discussing DenseNet-like architectures that utilize concatenative skip connections. These architectures contain DenseBlocks where input features are concatenated with the output features, before being fed into the next DenseBlock as shown in Fig. 11-II. The equation for this process is:

zi+1 = [zi,gi(zi)]

where zi is the input feature and gi(zi) is the output of the previous layer. This equation is critical to understanding how skip connections work in these architectures, which have been shown to be vulnerable to MI attacks. 
The results from the study on VGG show that attack accuracy ranges from 49.39% to 55.57%, which is significantly lower than the range for architectures with skip connections (82.76% to 90.78%). This suggests that architectures without skip connections may be more robust against MI attacks, but further research is needed to confirm this.

## 13.1 Removal of Concatenative Skip Connections

Here's the summarized result:

Removing concatenative skip connections from DenseNet-like architectures involves removing the concatenation process during feed forward processing within Dense-Blocks. The new latent representation from subsequent DenseBlocks can be expressed as <font color='red'>zi+1 = gi(zi)</font>, similar to our study on additive skip connections in ResNet-like architectures. This modification is depicted in Fig. 11-III. 
The key equation zi+1 = gi(zi) represents the new latent representation after removing concatenative skip connections, which is a crucial aspect of this study.

We strictly followed the implementations from official source codes for hyper-parameter selection, ensuring fair comparison between architectures with full skip connections and those with skip connections removed. 
<font color='red'>To ensure reproducibility of our findings</font>, we repeated main experiments reported in the original paper. Due to time-consuming nature of MI attacks, we selected key data points from the original paper and evaluated variations in results obtained. Specifically, we repeated stage-wise skip connection removal on ResNet-101 and DenseNet-121 (full and skip-4 removed configurations) for 3 times and reported mean natural accuracy and attack accuracy as well as standard deviation of attack accuracy obtained. 
For each experiment, we followed the setup as previous works, which included repeating key experiments to ensure reproducibility. This was particularly important given the time-consuming nature of MI attacks. 
The results were reported in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13, showing mean natural accuracy and attack accuracy as well as standard deviation of attack accuracy obtained.

**Model Inversion Attacks**

The study explores generative MI attacks due to their substantial implications for data privacy. It focuses on understanding the interaction with skip connections across five different MI attacks. 
A new head is introduced in KEDMI, allowing the discriminator to predict class-wise labels of input images. This approach advocates for latent distribution modeling to streamline inversion time and enhance the quality of generated samples. 
The authors propose a SOTA framework that highlights its modular nature, allowing for minimal adjustments to the attack setup across diverse architectures and datasets. 
**Metrics for MI Attack Evaluation**

Attack Accuracy (AttAcc), K-Nearest-Neighbors Distance (KNN Dist), and distance metrics δEvalNet and δFaceNet are used to assess the effectiveness of MI attacks. These metrics evaluate the similarity between inverted images and target images, and the feature similarity between reconstructed images and actual images belonging to the same class. 
**Key Findings**

*   The use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) enhances attack accuracy, surpassing traditional methodologies. *   Variations of δ distance metric arise based on the model employed to extract penultimate layer activations.

**Model Inversion (MI) Attacks**

Redefine MI attacks as a technique to extract private information from a trained machine learning model. This concept was first studied by Fredrikson et al. [15] who demonstrated that adversaries could employ machine learning to extract genomic and demographic information about patients from a medical imaging model. 
**Evolution of MI Studies**

Since then, several studies have been conducted to understand the feasibility and extent of reconstructing private training samples from Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). These studies encompass both MI attacks and MI defense perspectives. Recently, works analyzed the limitations of conventional MI objectives and proposed enhancements to MI attacks, such as PLGMI [56], LOMMA [39], PPA [43] utilizing logit maximization loss. 
**Regularization Techniques in MI**

Redefine regularization techniques in MI were explored to improve the realism of reconstructed images [57]. Advanced MI attacks for high-dimensional data examined the effect of distribu- tional priors in guiding MI. Specifically, GMI [57] used a pre-trained GAN [17] to learn the image structure of an auxiliary dataset with a similar structure to the target image space. 
**Defense Against MI Attacks**

Redefine regularizations on the training objective of the target model as methods to defend against MI attacks have been studied in [40,49]. More concretely, MID [49] limits the input-output dependency through a mutual information penalization, while BiDO [40] aims to minimize the dependency (via COCO [19] or HSIC [18] measurements) between latent representations and inputs. 
**Effect of DNN Architecture Design on MI**

Redefine the effect of DNN architecture design on MI is still an open question. Skip connections have been recognized as an effective approach to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem in training very deep networks. Noteworthy advanced deep neural networks, such as DenseNet [24], ResNet [23], MaxViT [47], EfficientNet [44,45], and others [10,12,31,51], leverage skip connections during training to improve their performance.
