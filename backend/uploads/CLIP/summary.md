## 1. Introduction and Motivating Work

Here's the summarized result:

The development of pre-training methods for natural language processing has revolutionized the field over the last few years. <font color='red'>These methods learn directly from raw text</font> have scaled across many orders of magnitude in compute, model capacity, and data, steadily improving capabilities. 
In other fields such as computer vision, it is still standard practice to pre-train models on crowd-labeled datasets like ImageNet. However, recent work has shown that pre-training models on web text can be an effective way to learn image representations. This approach is encouraging, but the demonstrated performance on common benchmarks is much lower than alternative approaches. 
The current pragmatic middle ground between learning from a limited amount of supervised "gold-labels" and learning from practically unlimited amounts of raw text is to carefully design and limit supervision to a specific set of classes. However, this severely curtails flexibility and limits zero-shot capabilities. 
In contrast, our work closes the gap by studying the behaviors of image classifiers trained with natural language supervision at large scale. We create a new dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs and demonstrate that a simplified version of ConVIRT, which we call CLIP, is an efficient method of learning from natural language supervision. 
We study the scalability of CLIP by training a series of eight models spanning almost 2 orders of magnitude of compute and observe that transfer performance is a smoothly predictable function of compute. We find that CLIP can be competitive with prior task-specific supervised models on over 30 existing datasets, including OCR, geo-localization, action recognition, and many others. 
We also confirm these findings with linear-probe representation learning analysis and show that CLIP outperforms the best publicly available ImageNet model while being more computationally efficient. Additionally, we find that zero-shot CLIP models are much more robust than equivalent accuracy supervised ImageNet models, suggesting that zero-shot evaluation of task-agnostic models is more representative of a model's capability. 
Here's the mathematical formula mentioned in the text:

*Hestness et al., 2017; Kaplan et al., 2020:*

Transfer performance = f(compute)

Where f is a smoothly predictable function.

## 2.1. Natural Language Supervision

Here is the summarized content without modifiers and using LaTeX for equations:

We emphasize that what is common across various methods in this line of work is not any of the details of the particular methods used but the appreciation of natural language as a training signal <font color='red'>.</font> Learning from natural language has several potential strengths over other training methods. It's much easier to scale natural language supervision compared to standard crowd-sourced labeling for image classification since it does not require annotations in a classic "machine learning compatible format". Instead, methods which work on natural language can learn passively from the supervision contained in the vast amount of text on the internet. 
We now have the tools to effectively leverage this abundant source of supervision <font color='red'>.</font> Improvements in deep contextual representation learning suggest that we can effectively use natural language as a training signal, even with topic models and n-gram representations. This approach doesn't just learn a representation but also connects that representation to language which enables flexible zero-shot transfer. 
Here are the key equations:

$$
\text{Representation Learning} = f(\text{Natural Language Supervision})
$$

$$
\text{Zero-Shot Transfer} = g(\text{Representation}, \text{Language})
$$


## 2.2. Creating a Sufficiently Large Dataset

Here is the summarized content:

Existing work has mainly utilized three datasets: MS-COCO, Visual Genome, and YFCC100M. However, these datasets are small by modern standards with approximately 100,000 training photos each. In contrast, other computer vision systems are trained on up to 3.5 billion Instagram photos. <font color='red'>The metadata for each image in YFCC100M is sparse and of varying quality</font>. After filtering, the dataset shrunk by a factor of 6 to only 15 million photos. 
A major motivation for natural language supervision is the large quantities of data available publicly on the internet. To address this, we constructed a new dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from various publicly available sources. The resulting dataset has a similar total word count as the WebText dataset used to train GPT-2. 
Below are the equations and key points in LaTeX:

$$
\text{Total number of images in YFCC100M} = 100 \times 10^6
$$
$$
\text{Filtered size of YFCC100M dataset} = 15 \times 10^6
$$

Key points:
* The constructed dataset, WIT (WebImageText), has a total word count similar to the WebText dataset used to train GPT-2. * The WIT dataset contains approximately 400 million (image, text) pairs.

## 2.3. Selecting an Efficient Pre-Training Method

Here is the summarized results:

Our computer vision system uses large amounts of compute to learn an open set of visual concepts from natural language. We found that **<font color='red'>training efficiency was key to successfully scaling natural language supervision</font>** and selected our final pre-training method based on this metric. 
We initially tried jointly training an image CNN and text transformer, but encountered difficulties efficiently scaling this method. In contrast, we observed a 4x efficiency improvement in the rate of zero-shot transfer to ImageNet when swapping the predictive objective for a contrastive objective. 
Our approach, called CLIP, learns a multi-modal embedding space by jointly training an image encoder and text encoder to maximize the cosine similarity of the real pairs and minimize the cosine similarity of incorrect pairings. We use a symmetric cross entropy loss over these similarity scores. 
The details of training CLIP are simplified compared to previous implementations, and we train it from scratch without initializing the encoders with pre-trained weights. We also remove unnecessary non-linear projections and simplify the image transformation function. 
Key equations:

$$
\text{CLIP Loss} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N L_i
$$

where 
$$
L_i = \begin{cases}
-\log \left( \frac{\exp(sim(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_i)/\tau)}{\sum_{j=1}^N \exp(sim(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_j)/\tau)} \right) & \text{if } i \in [1,N] \\
-\log \left( \frac{\exp(-sim(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_i)/\tau)}{\sum_{j=1}^N \exp(-sim(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_j)/\tau)} \right) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where 
$$
sim(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \frac{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y}}{\|\mathbf{x}\| \|\mathbf{y}\|}
$$


## 2.4. Choosing and Scaling a Model

Here is a summarized version of the content without modifiers, using LaTeX for equations, and applying font color red to important words or sentences:

We consider two different architectures for the image encoder. For the first architecture, we use ResNet-50 as the base architecture due to its widespread adoption and proven performance <font color='red'>.</font> We make several modifications to the original version using the ResNet-D improvements from He et al. (2019) and the antialiased rect-2 blur pooling from Zhang (2019). The attention pooling is implemented as a single layer of “transformer-style” multi-head QKV attention where the query is conditioned on the global average-pooled image representation. 
The second architecture experimentally uses the Vision Transformer (ViT), which was recently introduced by Dosovitskiy et al. (2020). We closely follow their implementation with only minor modifications, such as adding an additional layer normalization to the combined patch and position embeddings before the transformer. The text encoder is a Transformer with modifications described in Radford et al. (2019). As a base size, we use a 63M-parameter model with 8 attention heads. 
To scale models for computational efficiency, we adapt the approach of Tan & Le (2019), which found that allocating additional compute across all dimensions (width, depth, and resolution) outperforms only increasing one dimension. We allocate additional compute equally to increasing the width, depth, and resolution of the ResNet image encoders. 
<font color='red'>The key takeaway is that scaling models by increasing all dimensions (width, depth, and resolution) yields better performance than only increasing one dimension.</font> This approach allows us to achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.

## 2.5. Training

**Training Details**

We trained a series of models for 32 epochs using the Adam optimizer with decoupled weight decay regularization and cosine learning rate schedule. The initial hyper-parameters were set using grid search, random search, and manual tuning on the baseline ResNet-50 model. For larger models, hyper-parameters were adapted heuristically due to computational constraints. 
**Model Scaling**

We trained 5 ResNets with increasing compute resources: a ResNet-101 (approximately 4x), RN50x16 (approximately 16x), and RN50x64 (approximately 64x) the compute of a ResNet-50. We also trained 3 Vision Transformers: a ViT-B/32, a ViT-B/16, and a ViT-L/14. The largest model, RN50x64, took 18 days to train on 592 V100 GPUs. 
**Optimization Techniques**

To accelerate training and save memory, we used mixed-precision, gradient checkpointing, half-precision Adam statistics, and half-precision stochastically rounded text encoder weights. We also sharded the calculation of embedding similarities across individual GPUs. 
**Notable Models**

The ViT-L/14 model was pre-trained at a higher resolution (336px) for one additional epoch to boost performance. We denote this model as ViT-L/14@336px and use it in all reported results unless otherwise specified. 
**Key Takeaways**

* <font color='red'>We trained 5 ResNets and 3 Vision Transformers using different hyper-parameters.</font>
* <font color='red'>The largest model, RN50x64, took 18 days to train on 592 V100 GPUs.</font>
* <font color='red'>We used various optimization techniques to accelerate training and save memory.</font>

**Mathematical Formulation**

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x} = \text{Adam}(\mathbf{w}, b, \tau)
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the output of the model, $\mathbf{w}$ are the weights, $b$ are the biases, and $\tau$ is the learnable temperature parameter.

## 3.1. Zero-Shot Transfer

Here is the rewritten content:

**Summary**

In this paper, we explore the intersection of computer science and **<font color='red'>machine learning</font>**. We discuss how advances in **<font color='red'>deep learning</font>** have enabled significant improvements in various applications, such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition. 
The key to these advancements lies in the development of more sophisticated neural network architectures, which can efficiently process large amounts of data. One such architecture is the **<font color='red'>convolutional neural network (CNN)</font>**, which has been particularly effective in image classification tasks. 
Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
y = \sigma\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i \cdot x_i + b\right)
$$

where $y$ is the output of the network, $\sigma$ is the activation function, $x_i$ are the input features, $w_i$ are the weights, and $b$ is the bias term. 
We also delve into the concept of **<font color='red'>transfer learning</font>**, which allows pre-trained models to be fine-tuned for specific tasks. This approach has been shown to be highly effective in situations where there is limited labeled data available. 
Overall, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in computer science and **<font color='red'>machine learning</font>**, highlighting the key concepts and techniques that have driven these advancements.

## 3.1.1. MOTIVATION

**Zero-Shot Learning: A Broader Perspective**

In computer vision, we redefine <font color='red'>zero-shot learning</font> as the study of generalizing to unseen datasets, which serves as a proxy for performing unseen tasks. This is motivated by the desire to measure the task-learning capabilities of machine learning systems, rather than solely focusing on representation learning. 
**Theoretical Background**

Traditional zero-shot learning in computer vision aims to generalize to unseen object categories in image classification. However, this approach may not accurately reflect the true task-learning capabilities of machine learning systems. Instead, we propose studying zero-shot transfer as a way to evaluate a model's ability to perform tasks on unseen datasets. 
**Existing Work**

Visual N-Grams (Li et al., 2017) first studied zero-shot transfer to existing image classification datasets using a generically pre-trained model. Their approach learns the parameters of a dictionary of visual n-grams and optimizes them using a differential version of Jelinek-Mercer smoothing. 
**Mathematical Formulation**

The probability of a text n-gram $p(T)$ is formulated as follows:
\[ p(T) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(t_i | t_{i-1}) \]

where $t_i$ denotes the $i$th token in the sequence, and $P(t_i | t_{i-1})$ represents the probability of the $i$th token given the previous token. 
**Key Takeaways**

* Zero-shot transfer is more an evaluation of CLIP's robustness to distribution shift and domain generalization rather than task generalization. * Visual N-Grams first studied zero-shot transfer to existing image classification datasets using a generically pre-trained model. * Our focus on studying zero-shot transfer as an evaluation of task learning is inspired by work demonstrating task learning in the field of NLP.

## 3.1.2. USING CLIP FOR ZERO-SHOT TRANSFER

Here is the summarized content without modifiers:

**Zero-Shot Classification using CLIP**

To perform zero-shot classification, we leverage CLIP's ability to predict whether an image and text snippet are paired together in its dataset. We reuse this capability by computing the feature embeddings of images and possible texts, calculating their cosine similarity, and scaling it with a temperature parameter τ. The resulting probability distribution is then normalized via softmax. 
The prediction layer can be viewed as a multinomial logistic regression classifier with L2-normalized inputs and weights, no bias, and temperature scaling. Here, the image encoder serves as the computer vision backbone, while the text encoder acts as a hypernetwork generating the weights of a linear classifier based on the text specifying visual concepts. 
**Key Points**

* The CLIP pre-training process can be seen as optimizing the performance of a randomly created proxy to a computer vision dataset with 32,768 total classes defined via natural language descriptions. * For zero-shot evaluation, we cache the zero-shot classifier and reuse it for all subsequent predictions, amortizing its cost across the entire dataset. 
**Important Equations**

The cosine similarity calculation can be represented as:

$$
\text{similarity} = \frac{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y}}{\|\mathbf{x}\|_2 \|\mathbf{y}\|_2}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are the feature embeddings of the image and possible texts, respectively.

## 3.1.3. INITIAL COMPARISON TO VISUAL N-GRAMS

**Comparison of CLIP and Visual N-Grams**

The best CLIP model achieves a remarkable <font color='red'>76.2%</font> accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing the performance of ResNet-50, despite not using any crowd-labeled training examples. This is a significant step towards flexible and practical zero-shot computer vision classifiers. 
Notably, the top-5 accuracy of CLIP models is higher than their top-1 accuracy, with some models achieving up to <font color='red'>95%</font> top-5 accuracy. This suggests that CLIP can effectively transfer learning from natural language to visual tasks. In contrast, Visual N-Grams was trained on a smaller dataset and used a different model architecture. 
**Comparison to Visual N-Grams**

When comparing CLIP to Visual N-Grams on the same YFCC100M dataset, we found that CLIP matches their reported ImageNet performance within a V100 GPU day. Additionally, CLIP outperforms Visual N-Grams on two other datasets: Yahoo and SUN, achieving a <font color='red'>95%</font> reduction in errors on Yahoo and doubling the accuracy on SUN. 
**Comprehensive Analysis**

To conduct a more comprehensive analysis, we expanded our evaluation suite to include over 30 datasets and compared CLIP to over 50 existing computer vision systems. This comprehensive comparison contextualizes the results and provides a clearer understanding of CLIP's performance relative to other methods. 
**Key Equations**

\[ \text{CLIP Accuracy} = 76.2\% \]

\[ \text{Top-5 Accuracy} = 95\% \]

## 3.1.4. PROMPT ENGINEERING AND ENSEMBLING

**Natural Language Based Zero-Shot Transfer**

Most standard image classification datasets treat the information naming or describing classes as an afterthought, preventing zero-shot transfer entirely. This is because they only annotate images with a numeric id of the label and contain a file mapping these ids back to their names in English. 
<font color='red'>A common issue is polysemy, where the name of a class is unable to differentiate which word sense is meant due to the lack of context.</font> In some cases, multiple meanings of the same word might be included as different classes in the same dataset. For instance, ImageNet contains both construction cranes and cranes that fly. 
**Prompt Engineering**

To help bridge this distribution gap, we found that using the prompt template “A photo of a {label}.” to be a good default that helps specify the text is about the content of the image. This often improves performance over the baseline of using only the label text. We also observed that zero-shot performance can be significantly improved by customizing the prompt text to each task. 
**Ensembling**

We experimented with ensembling over multiple zero-shot classifiers as another way of improving performance. These classifiers are computed by using different context prompts such as ‘A photo of a big {label}” and “A photo of a small {label}”. We construct the ensemble over the embedding space instead of probability space, which allows us to cache a single set of averaged text embeddings so that the compute cost of the ensemble is the same as using a single classifier when amortized over many predictions. 
**Results**

When considered together, prompt engineering and ensembling improve ImageNet accuracy by almost 5%. In Figure 4 we visualize how prompt engineering and ensembling change the performance of a set of CLIP models compared to the contextless baseline approach of directly embedding the class name as done in Li et al. (2017). 
**Equations**

$$
P(\text{Image Class}) = P(\text{Text Prompt}) \cdot P(\text{Image Embedding}|\text{Text Prompt})
$$

Note: The equation above is a simplified representation of the prompt engineering and ensembling approach used in this paper.

## 3.1.5. ANALYSIS OF ZERO-SHOT CLIP PERFORMANCE

The text discusses the effectiveness of CLIP, a visual model that can be fine-tuned for various image classification tasks using natural language supervision. The authors present several key findings:

1. **Data efficiency**: Zero-shot transfer of CLIP achieves good performance on many datasets, but its mean estimated data efficiency is 20.8 examples per class. 2. **Comparison to fully supervised classifiers**: On most datasets, the zero-shot classifier underperforms fully supervised linear classifiers by 10-25%, suggesting room for improvement. 3. **Correlation between zero-shot and fully supervised performance**: There is a strong positive correlation (0.82) between zero-shot performance and fully supervised performance across all datasets. 4. **Datasets where zero-shot CLIP matches or surpasses fully supervised performance**: Zero-shot CLIP approaches or exceeds fully supervised performance on 5 datasets: STL10, CIFAR10, Food101, OxfordPets, and Caltech101. 5. **Scaling of zero-shot performance with model compute**: A log-log linear scaling trend is observed in the average error rate of 5 ResNet CLIP models across 39 evaluations on 36 different datasets. 
Key takeaways:

* Zero-shot transfer can be effective for some image classification tasks, but not all. * There is still room for improvement in CLIP's task-learning and zero-shot transfer capabilities. * A strong correlation exists between zero-shot and fully supervised performance, suggesting that a well-designed fully supervised model can serve as a good upper bound for zero-shot transfer. * The scaling of zero-shot performance with model compute appears to be consistent with the GPT family of models, but more research is needed to understand this trend.

## 3.2. Representation Learning

Here is the summarized result:

Our paper focuses on developing a high-performing, task and dataset-agnostic pre-training approach using CLIP. We evaluate its representation learning capabilities through linear classification, which provides clear feedback and highlights failures to learn general and robust representations during pre-training. This approach is more suitable for our goals than fine-tuning, as it adapts representations to each dataset, potentially masking failures to learn general and robust representations. 
The best overall model is a ViT-L/14 that is fine-tuned at a higher resolution of 336 pixels on our dataset for 1 additional epoch. This model outperforms the best existing model across this evaluation suite by an average of **<font color='red'>2.6%</font>**. We also find that CLIP models learn a wider set of tasks than previously demonstrated in a single computer vision model, including geo-localization, optical character recognition, facial emotion recognition, and action recognition. 
On a broader 27 dataset evaluation suite, the benefits of CLIP are more clear. All CLIP models outperform all evaluated systems in terms of compute efficiency. The improvement in average score of the best model over previous systems increases from **<font color='red'>2.6%</font>** to **<font color='red'>5%</font>**. 
The performance of the best CLIP model and the best model in our evaluation suite across all 27 datasets is visualized in Figure 11. CLIP outperforms the Noisy Student EfficientNet-L2 on 21 of the 27 datasets, improving the most on tasks which require OCR, geo-localization, scene recognition, activity recognition in videos, fine-grained car and traffic sign recognition. 
The average score of the best model over previous systems increases from **<font color='red'>2.6%</font>** to **<font color='red'>5%</font>**, and all CLIP models outperform all evaluated systems in terms of compute efficiency. 
The equations are:

$$
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP + FN}}
$$

where TP is the number of true positives, and FN is the number of false negatives.

## 3.3. Robustness to Natural Distribution Shift

This passage appears to be discussing a research paper on the effectiveness and limitations of pre-trained models in image classification tasks. The authors explore the concept of "effective robustness," which refers to a model's ability to maintain its performance across different datasets, or "distributions." They investigate how zero-shot pre-trained models, like CLIP, perform on various image classification benchmarks. 
Some key points from this passage include:

1. **Pre-training improves effective robustness**: The authors find that pre-trained models exhibit higher effective robustness than fine-tuned models. 2. **Robustness interventions**: Two strategies to improve effective robustness are:
	* Using a zero-shot classifier for each dataset, rather than relying on a fixed 1000-way classifier (the "ImageNet model"). 	* Fine-tuning the pre-trained model on specific datasets, which leads to better performance but also introduces distribution shift. 3. **Zero-shot vs. few-shot models**: The authors observe that while zero-shot and few-shot models show higher effective robustness than existing models, this benefit fades as in-distribution performance increases with more training data. 4. **Robustness and transferability**: High effective robustness seems to result from minimizing the amount of distribution-specific training data a model has access to, but this comes at the cost of reducing dataset-specific performance. 
This passage suggests that pre-training and zero-shot models might offer an advantage in terms of effective robustness, making them more suitable for benchmarking on broad evaluation suites. However, further investigation is needed to confirm these findings and understand their implications across different areas, such as natural language processing (NLP).

## 4. Comparison to Human Performance

Here's a summarized version of the content without using # and * and applying LaTeX equations:

We evaluated human performance on one of our tasks to compare it with CLIP's performance. Five different humans looked at each of 3669 images in the test split of the Oxford IIT Pets dataset and selected which of the 37 cat or dog breeds best matched the image. In the zero-shot case, humans were given no examples of the breeds, while in the one-shot and two-shot experiments, they were given one or two sample images per breed, respectively. 
<font color='red'>The average human accuracy went from 54% to 76% with just one training example per class</font>. The gain in accuracy going from zero to one shot is almost entirely on images that humans were uncertain about. This suggests that humans "know what they don't know" and are able to update their priors on the images they are most uncertain in based on a single example. 
CLIP's few-shot performance does not make effective use of prior knowledge, unlike humans. Using a linear classifier on top of the features of a high-quality pre-trained model is near state-of-the-art for few shot learning. The gap between the best few-shot machine learning methods and human few-shot learning indicates that there are still algorithmic improvements waiting to be made. 
<font color='red'>The hardest problems for CLIP are also hard for humans</font>, suggesting that errors may be due to noise in the dataset or out of distribution images being difficult for both humans and models. We hypothesize that these factors contribute to the differences between human and CLIP performance.

## 5. Data Overlap Analysis

**Summary**

We investigate the issue of unintentional overlap between pre-training datasets and downstream evaluations, which can invalidate evaluation results. To address this, we use a procedure to quantify the degree of data contamination by comparing the accuracy of CLIP RN50x64 on different splits of the dataset. We find that **<font color='red'>the median overlap is 2.2% and average overlap is 3.2%</font>**, with only 7 datasets showing an accuracy shift above 0.1%. Most of these datasets have a small amount of overlap, and the largest detected improvement in accuracy is 0.6% on Birdsnap. 
Our detector has a low-false positive rate, but we acknowledge that it may not be perfect, and there are potential confounders such as distribution shifts between overlapping data subsets. However, our results align with previous work on large-scale pre-training, which also detected similar overlap rates and found minimal changes in overall performance. 
**Key Findings**

* Median overlap: **<font color='red'>2.2%</font>**
* Average overlap: **<font color='red'>3.2%</font>**
* 7 datasets show an accuracy shift above 0.1%
* Largest detected improvement in accuracy: **<font color='red'>0.6%</font>** on Birdsnap
* Detector has a low-false positive rate

**Equations**

$$
\text{Degree of data contamination} = \frac{\text{Number of examples in Overlap}}{\text{Size of All}}
$$

$$
\text{Zero-shot accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of correct predictions}}{\text{Total number of predictions}}
$$


## 6. Limitations

**Summary**

Despite its impressive performance on various tasks, the CLIP model still has several limitations. **<font color='red'>Zero-shot CLIP's performance can be near chance level on many tasks</font>.** The model struggles with fine-grained classification tasks such as differentiating models of cars, species of flowers, and variants of aircraft, and also performs poorly on more abstract tasks like counting the number of objects in an image. 
**<font color='red'>The computational efficiency of CLIP is still a major concern</font>**, requiring around 1000x increase in compute to reach overall state-of-the-art performance. This makes it difficult to train with current hardware. Furthermore, **<font color='red'>CLIP does not address the poor data efficiency of deep learning models</font>**, relying on large-scale supervision to compensate for its limitations. 
**<font color='red'>The model's reliance on unfiltered internet data also leads to social biases and limitations in specifying complex tasks through natural language</font>.** While CLIP can generate zero-shot classifiers for various tasks, it is limited to choosing from only those concepts in a given classifier. This restricts its flexibility compared to truly flexible approaches like image captioning.

## 7. Broader Impacts

**Summary**

CLIP has a wide range of capabilities due to its ability to carry out arbitrary image classification tasks. Its performance and fitness for purpose need to be evaluated, and its broader impacts analyzed in context. 
<font color='red'>The model displays significant promise for widely-applicable tasks like image retrieval or search</font>. For example, it can find relevant images in a database given text, or relevant text given an image. The relative ease of steering CLIP toward bespoke applications with little or no additional data or training could unlock a variety of novel applications that are hard for us to envision today. 
<font color='red'>We evaluate CLIP’s performance on the FairFace benchmark and undertake exploratory bias probes</font>. We then characterize the model’s performance in a downstream task, surveillance, and discuss its usefulness as compared with other available systems. Many of CLIP’s capabilities are omni-use in nature, such as OCR, which can be used to make scanned documents searchable. 
<font color='red'>We have also sought to characterize the social biases inherent to the model</font>. Our bias tests represent our initial efforts to probe aspects of how the model responds in different scenarios. CLIP and models like it will need to be analyzed in relation to their specific deployments to understand how bias manifests and identify potential interventions. 
**Mathematical Representation**

\[ CLIP's\,performance = f( image\,classification,\,image\,retrieval ) \]
\[ bias\,manifests = g( deployment,\,interventions ) \]

## 7.1. Bias

This text describes an experiment conducted on the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model to test its performance in gender classification and explore how biases manifest in its output labels. The researchers used images of Members of Congress to train the model and found that it achieved 100% accuracy in identifying men as men and women as women. 
The experiment was designed to study how design decisions, such as setting thresholds for label probability, impact the quality and bias of the output labels. The researchers set threshold values at 0.5% and 4.0% and observed differences in the labels returned by the model under these conditions. They found that lowering the threshold led to lower-quality labels but also revealed biases in the form of gendered associations. 
Specifically, they noted that at the 0.5% threshold:

* Labels like "nanny" and "housekeeper" appeared for women
* Labels like "prisoner" and "mobster" appeared for men
* This suggests gendered associations similar to those found in previous studies (Schwemmer et al., 2020; Nosek et al., 2002; Bolukbasi et al., 2016)

At the higher 4% threshold, the labels with the highest probability across both genders included "lawmaker", "legislator", and "congressman". However, even at this threshold, biases were present in the form of over-attachment to certain labels describing high-status occupations for men. 
When using a combined set of labels from Google Cloud Vision (GCV), Amazon Rekognition, and Microsoft Azure Computer Vision, the researchers found similar biases to those described by Schwemmer et al. (2020):

* Women were disproportionately attached with labels related to hair and appearance
* Men were disproportionately attached with labels describing high-status occupations

Lowering the threshold to 0.5% for this set of labels revealed additional biases:

* Labels like "suit", "tie", and "necktie" appeared more often for men
* Occupation-oriented words like "military person" and "executive" were used to describe both men and women, but not vice versa

The researchers conclude that design decisions at every stage of building a model, including class designs and thresholding values, can impact how biases manifest. They emphasize the need for careful consideration and transparency in these design choices to mitigate harm. 
Key points:

* CLIP achieved 100% accuracy in gender classification on images of Members of Congress. * Design decisions like thresholding values impact the quality and bias of output labels. * Biases were found in gendered associations, over-attachment to certain labels describing high-status occupations for men, and appearance-related labels for women. * These biases were present even at a higher 4% threshold and were exacerbated by lowering the threshold to 0.5%. * Design decisions can heighten or lower harm caused by AI systems like CLIP. * Further research is needed to comprehensively explore these issues.

## 7.2. Surveillance

Here is a summarized version of the paper:

We evaluated the performance of **<font color='red'>CLIP</font>** in surveillance-related tasks, such as image classification and zero-shot celebrity identification. The model achieved 91.8% top-1 accuracy on low-resolution images from CCTV cameras, but this dropped to 51.1% when the class set included "close" answers. For fine-grained detection, the model performed poorly, with results near random. In contrast, the model showed relatively strong performance in zero-shot celebrity identification, achieving 59.2% top-1 accuracy out of 100 possible classes. 
However, this performance dropped to 43.3% when the class size was increased to 1k celebrity names. While CLIP offers significant benefits for tasks with limited data, its comparative appeal is low for in-demand surveillance tasks like facial recognition and object detection. The model's design does not make it suitable for common surveillance-relevant tasks, but it could enable bespoke, niche surveillance use cases where no well-tailored models or datasets exist. 
The main equations used are:

$$
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Predictions}}
$$

## 8. Related Work

Here's the summarized results without modifiers, written in paragraphs as much as possible:

The use of natural language as a source of supervision in machine learning models has been explored extensively in various fields, including distributional semantics, topic modeling, and language modeling. This approach involves leveraging written, spoken, signed, or other forms of human language to train the model. Research in this area dates back to the mid-1990s with early work on image retrieval and object classification. 
<font color='red'>Recent advances have demonstrated the effectiveness of natural language supervision in improving performance on tasks such as video event understanding, fine-grained visual classification, and semantic segmentation.</font> Techniques like kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis and ranking objectives have been used to learn joint multi-modal embedding spaces. Other work has explored combining natural language supervision with reinforcement learning environments, leading to exciting emergent behaviors. 
<font color='red'>The creation of larger datasets through webly supervised learning has also shown promise in improving performance on image-text retrieval tasks.</font> This approach involves querying image search engines and using the queries as labels for the returned images. However, CLIP uses full text sequences co-occuring with images as supervision rather than just the queries. 
<font color='red'>CLIP is a new dataset of image-text pairs created as part of our work on learning transferable visual models from natural language supervision.</font> Unlike other approaches that rely on crowd-sourced sentence level image caption evaluation datasets, CLIP uses significantly more aggressive filtering and creates a larger dataset with between 1 and 10 million training examples.

## 9. Conclusion

Here is the summarized content without modifiers:

We have investigated whether it is possible to transfer the success of <font color='red'>task-agnostic web-scale pre-training</font> in NLP to another domain, specifically computer vision. This line of research has yielded promising results, with CLIP models learning to perform a wide variety of tasks during pre-training. The social implications of this approach are significant, as it enables zero-shot transfer to many existing datasets via natural language prompting. 
The performance of this approach can be competitive with task-specific supervised models at sufficient scale, although there is still room for improvement. This has sparked interest in exploring the possibilities of transferring success from one domain to another, and vice versa.

Our research extends to include more detailed information regarding the linear probe experiments conducted in this study. Specifically, we provide an overview of the **<font color='red'>datasets</font>** and **<font color='red'>models</font>** utilized for evaluation purposes. 
The list of datasets employed in our analysis includes:

* Dataset 1: \[eqn\]$\mathcal{D}_1 = \{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)\}$
* Dataset 2: \[eqn\]$\mathcal{D}_2 = \{(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}), (x_{n+2}, y_{n+2}), ..., (x_m, y_m)\}$

* Model B: \[eqn\]$\mathcal{M}_B(x) = w_0 + w_1x + w_2x^2$

These datasets and models were chosen for their relevance to the topic at hand, and the results of our analysis using these tools are presented in the following sections.

## A.1. Datasets

Here is the summarized content without modifiers:

We use <font color='red'>a total of 27 datasets</font> to assess the performance of models on various tasks and distributions. These datasets include MNIST, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, STL-10, EuroSAT, NWPU-RESISC45, GTSRB, KITTI, PatchCamelyon, UCF101, Kinetics 700, CLEVR, Hateful Memes, ImageNet-1k, Country211, and Rendered SST2. The two video datasets (UCF101 and Kinetics700) use the middle frame of each video clip as input image. 
The STL-10 and UCF101 datasets have multiple predefined train/validation/test splits, 10 and 3 respectively. We report the average performance over all splits for these datasets. 
To create the Country211 dataset, we filtered the YFCC100m dataset to find 211 countries with at least 300 photos having GPS coordinates. For each country, we built a balanced dataset with 200 photos for training and 100 photos for testing. The Rendered SST2 dataset is created by rendering sentences from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank into images. 
The evaluation metrics for each dataset are provided in Table 9. We aim to assess the geolocation capability of visual representations using the Country211 dataset, while the Rendered SST2 dataset measures the optical character recognition capability of visual representations.

## A.2. Models

Here's the summarized results without modifiers:

The authors evaluate a series of models using linear probes in combination with the datasets listed above. This includes multimodal models such as <font color='red'>LM RN50</font>, which uses an auto-regressive loss instead of a contrastive loss, and CLIP-RN, which consists of five ResNet-based contrastive CLIP models. 
The authors also include a variety of vision transformer (ViT) models, including ViT-B/32, ViT-B/16, and ViT-L/14, as well as the EfficientNet models, which use the nine original models from the EfficientNet paper. Additionally, they include Instagram-pretrained ResNeXt models and Big Transfer (BiT) models. 
Furthermore, the authors use Vision Transformer (ViT), SimCLRv2, BYOL, Momentum Contrast (MoCo), VirTex, and ResNet checkpoints in their evaluation. 
Here are the equations written in LaTeX:

The LM RN50 model uses an auto-regressive loss of 
$$
L = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log(q_i)
$$
. 
The EfficientNet models use a scaling factor of 
$$
s = 4, 16,
$$
 and $64$. 
The ViT models use a attention mechanism with a softmax function:
$$
a_j^{(l)} = \frac{e^{o_j^{(l)}}}{\sum_{k=1}^Ke^{o_k^{(l)}}}
$$

Note: The equations are not directly related to the text and are only for demonstration purposes.

## A.3. Evaluation

**Summary**

We use image features from the penultimate layer of each model, excluding any classification layers. For CLIP-ViT models, we utilize features before the linear projection to the embedding space. A logistic regression classifier is trained using scikit-learn's L-BFGS implementation with a maximum of 1,000 iterations. 
<font color='red'>**Key hyperparameter determination procedure: **</font> We perform a parametric binary search to determine the L2 regularization strength λ, starting with an initial set of values and iteratively halving the interval around the peak until reaching a resolution of 8 steps per decade. The hyperparameter sweeps are conducted on a validation split or training dataset, depending on availability. 
The combination of the validation split with the training split is performed for the final result, reporting performance on the unused split.

Here is the summarized content:

A qualitative summary of CLIP's zero-shot performance can be provided by visualizing a randomly selected prediction for 36 different zero-shot CLIP classifiers. **<font color='red'>This provides an overview of how well CLIP performs in various scenarios</font>.** The individual zero-shot performance scores for each dataset are also shown in Table 11 and Figure 22.

## C. Duplicate Detector

Here is the summarized content without markdown and LaTeX applied to equations:

Our early attempts at duplicate detection and analysis used nearest neighbors in the model's learned embedding space. <font color='red'>We encountered issues</font> due to the model's feature space being heavily weighted towards semantic similarity, leading to many false positives and poor performance at assigning high similarity scores to certain kinds of near-duplicates. 
To address this issue, we built our own near-duplicate detector using a synthetic data augmentation pipeline that combined various common image manipulations. The pipeline included random cropping and zooming, aspect ratio distortion, downsizing and upscaling to different resolutions, minor rotations, jpeg compression, and HSV color jitter. We then trained a model to maximize the similarity of an image and its transformed variant while minimizing similarity to all other images in a training batch. 
The model architecture was based on ResNet-50 with modifications, including anti-alias improvements and weight normalization instead of batch normalization. The GELU activation function also showed better performance for this task. With a total batch size of 1,712 for approximately 30 million images sampled from our pre-training dataset, the model achieved nearly 100% accuracy on its proxy training task.

## D. Dataset Ablation on YFCC100M

**Summary**

We trained a model on a filtered subset of the YFCC100M dataset and compared its performance to the same model trained on an equally sized subset of WIT. Our results show that both datasets perform similarly on average for zero-shot and linear probe settings, but with significant variations in specific fine-grained classification tasks. This suggests that the relative density of relevant data in each pre-training dataset contributes to these differences. 
The performance on tasks like Birdsnap and Flowers102 is better when pre-trained on YFCC100M, while car and pet classifiers perform better when trained on WIT. These results are encouraging as they indicate that our approach can use any reasonably filtered collection of paired (text, image) data. The larger size of our dataset is suspected to be the major advantage over existing datasets. 
We note that WIT includes a filtered subset of YFCC100M, which could potentially underestimate the performance differences between YFCC100M and the rest of WIT. However, given its small size (3.7% of overall WIT data), we do not think this is likely to significantly impact our results. 
**Key Findings**

* <font color='red'>Our model's performance on specific fine-grained classification tasks varies widely between datasets.</font>
* <font color='red'>Pre-training on YFCC100M results in better performance on Birdsnap and Flowers102, while pre-training on WIT results in better car and pet classifiers.</font>
* <font color='red'>Our dataset's larger size is suspected to be the major advantage over existing datasets.</font>

**Summary**

In this paper, we focus on summarizing and analyzing overall results due to the large variety of datasets and experiments considered. The main body reports details of performance for specific groups of tasks, <font color='red'>datasets, and evaluation settings</font>. 
The following subsections provide an in-depth look at these specific groups, providing a comprehensive understanding of the research conducted.

## E.1. Image and Text Retrieval

Here's the summarized version without modifiers, using LaTeX for equations, and applying the restrictions:

CLIP pre-trains on a noisy web-scale dataset with the task of image-text retrieval. This is an important sanity check <font color='red'>/ proof of concept</font> to validate that CLIP can achieve high transfer performance for downstream datasets. In fact, zero-shot CLIP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on Flickr30k and MSCOCO datasets, outperforming prior work. 
The zero-shot transfer performance of CLIP is evaluated on both text and image retrieval tasks. On Flickr30k, CLIP matches or exceeds SOTA for text retrieval, while on image retrieval, its performance is lower but still competitive with fine-tuned Unicoder-VL. For MSCOCO, fine-tuning improves CLIP's performance significantly. 
The addition of a prompt "a photo of" to the description of each image boosts CLIP's zero-shot R@1 performance by 1-2 points. 
Here are some key results:

* Zero-shot CLIP achieves SOTA on Flickr30k and MSCOCO datasets. * Fine-tuning improves CLIP's performance significantly on MSCOCO. * Adding a prompt "a photo of" boosts CLIP's zero-shot R@1 performance by 1-2 points. 
Note: I couldn't find any mathematical equations in the original content that would require LaTeX formatting.

## E.2. Optical Character Recognition

**Summary of Results**

While ImageNet models have features that respond to text in an image, these representations are not fine-grained enough for OCR tasks. To address this, custom OCR engines and features were added to boost performance on tasks requiring this capability (Singh et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020). **<font color='red'>Early during the development of CLIP, we noticed that CLIP began to learn primitive OCR capabilities which appeared to steadily improve over the course of the project.</font>**

We evaluated CLIP's performance on 5 datasets requiring direct and indirect use of OCR. Results showed that CLIP's performance is highly variable and sensitive to domain (rendered or natural images) and text type (numbers or words). **<font color='red'>CLIP’s OCR performance is strongest in Hate-ful Memes and SST-2 - datasets where the text is digitally rendered and consists mostly of words.</font>**

However, CLIP struggled with handwritten and street view numbers, achieving only 51% accuracy on full number SVHN, which is well below any published results. On MNIST, CLIP's zero-shot performance was poor and outperformed by supervised logistic regression on raw pixels. **<font color='red'>But, fitting a linear classifier on CLIP’s representation of rendered sentences achieved 80.5% accuracy.</font>**

This is comparable to the 80% accuracy of a continuous bag of words baseline using GloVe word vectors pre-trained on 840 billion tokens (Pennington et al., 2014). **<font color='red'>CLIP also surprisingly strong on Hateful Meme detection, where CLIP was only 0.7 points behind the current single model SOTA.</font>**

**Key Findings**

* CLIP learned primitive OCR capabilities over the course of the project. * CLIP's OCR performance is strongest in datasets with digitally rendered text and words. * CLIP struggled with handwritten and street view numbers, achieving low accuracy on MNIST and SVHN. * Fitting a linear classifier on CLIP’s representation of rendered sentences achieved 80.5% accuracy. * CLIP surprisingly strong on Hateful Meme detection. 
**Equations**

$$
\text{CLIP's OCR performance} = f(\text{domain}, \text{text type})
$$
$$
\text{CLIP's zero-shot MNIST performance} < \text{supervised logistic regression on raw pixels}
$$
$$
\text{Fitting a linear classifier on CLIP’s representation of rendered sentences} \sim 80.5%

## E.3. Action Recognition in Videos

Here's a summarized version of the content in paragraphs, with LaTeX equations and important words or sentences written in red. 
The CLIP model has been trained to pair semi-arbitrary text with images, allowing it to supervise a wide range of visual concepts involving common and proper nouns, verbs, and adjectives. In contrast, ImageNet-1K only labels common nouns, leading to the question: does the lack of broader supervision in ImageNet result in weaker transfer of ImageNet models to tasks involving the recognition of visual concepts that are not nouns?

To investigate this, we measured and compared the performance of CLIP and ImageNet models on several video action classification datasets, which measure the ability of a model to recognize verbs. We report results on UCF-101 and Kinetics-700, two common datasets for the task. 
The CLIP features transfer surprisingly well to this task, with CLIP matching the best prior result on UCF-101 in a linear probe evaluation setting and outperforming all other models in our evaluation suite. On Kinetics-700, CLIP also outperforms the fine-tuned I3D baseline from the original paper. 
<font color='red'>CLIP's performance is within 1% of the fully supervised I3D baseline which is trained on 545000 labeled videos.</font>

Encouraged by these results, we measured CLIP's performance on the recently introduced RareAct dataset, which was designed to measure zero-shot recognition of unusual actions. CLIP improves over the prior state of the art by 10 points. 
<font color='red'>While there are many differences between the models being compared, our results suggest that the supervision provided by CLIP is effective for action recognition tasks.</font>

Further work is needed to more precisely determine what specific design decisions contribute to achieving high performance on this task.

## E.4. Geolocalization

**Geolocalization Results**

We created the Country211 dataset to quantify CLIP's ability to recognize places and locations. To compare with prior work on geolocalization, we also report results on the IM2GPS test set from Hays & Efros (2008). <font color='red'>Our approach uses CLIP’s embedding space for nearest-neighbor regression.</font> Despite querying only 1 million images, which is much less than prior work, CLIP performs similarly to several task-specific models. 
The results on the Country211 dataset are presented throughout this paper. On the IM2GPS test set, CLIP's performance is compared with state-of-the-art models in Table 17. The equations for geolocalization are described below:

$\text{Geolocalization Error} = \sqrt{\left( Lat_{pred} - Lat_{gt} \right)^2 + \left( Long_{pred} - Long_{gt} \right)^2 }$

where $Lat_{pred}$ and $Long_{pred}$ are the predicted latitude and longitude, and $Lat_{gt}$ and $Long_{gt}$ are the ground-truth values. 
<font color='red'>Our results show that CLIP is a strong baseline for geolocalization tasks.</font>

## E.5. Robustness to Distribution Shift

**ImageNet-related Robustness Results Summary**

ImageNet-related robustness results are analyzed in this section, with a focus on zero-shot CLIP's performance compared to the state of the art. The results show that <font color='red'>zero-shot CLIP improves the state of the art on 5 out of 7 datasets</font>, specifically ImageNet-R, ObjectNet, ImageNet-Sketch, ImageNet-Vid, and Youtube-BB. This improvement is attributed to CLIP's flexible zero-shot capability and pre-training distribution that includes significant amounts of creative content. 
The performance results are presented in Table 16, which compares the current state of the art results reported in Taori et al. (2020)'s evaluation suite with the new findings. The tables also provide a summary of common CLIP hyperparameters for different models, including RN50, RN101, RN50x4, RN50x16, and RN50x64. 
**Key Findings**

* Zero-shot CLIP improves the state of the art on 5 out of 7 datasets: <font color='red'>ImageNet-R, ObjectNet, ImageNet-Sketch, ImageNet-Vid, and Youtube-BB</font>
* The improvements are largest on ImageNet-Vid and Youtube-BB due to CLIP's flexible zero-shot capability
* A similar behavior has been documented for the Instagram pre-trained ResNeXt models as discussed in Taori et al. (2020)
