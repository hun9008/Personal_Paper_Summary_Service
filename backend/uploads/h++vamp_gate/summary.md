## INTRODUCTION

**Summary**

The immense size and diversity of Web-based services make it difficult for individual users to search and find online content without recommender systems. Recent studies have incorporated deep learning into these systems, focusing on the use of autoencoders and generative models that model latent variables of user preference. We aim to overcome problematic characteristics of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) in collaborative filtering tasks and tailor them for improved performance. 
<font color='red'>Two main motivations led our research:</font> 1) The current prior distribution used in VAEs may be too restrictive, hindering the models from learning richer latent variables of user preference which is crucial to model performance. 2) Learning from user-item interaction history has its own characteristics and may have more effective architectures to learn deeper latent representations. 
We implemented hierarchical variational autoencoders with VampPrior to learn richer latent representations of user preferences from interaction history, and used Gated Linear Units (GLUs) to effectively control information flow. Coupling the gating mechanism with the aforementioned VampPrior significantly boosted the performance of the variational autoencoding CF framework. 
**Equations**

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x} = \text{Encoder}(\mathbf{\mu}, \mathbf{\sigma})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
p(\mathbf{x}) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(\mathbf{x}|g) \cdot p(g) d g
\end{equation}

**Contributions**

Our proposed method showed significant improvements in NDCG and recall compared to baseline models, including state-of-the-art matrix factorization and autoencoder based methods. The key contributions of our work are:

1. Implementation of hierarchical variational autoencoders with VampPrior for learning richer latent representations of user preferences. 2. Use of Gated Linear Units (GLUs) for effectively controlling information flow in the network. 
**Results**

Our proposed method was compared to baseline models on two popular benchmark datasets: MovieLens-20M and Netflix, and showed significant improvements in NDCG and recall.

## 2 RELATED WORK

**Deep Learning in Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems**

Research has incorporated deep learning into collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems, extending traditional matrix factorization frameworks. Autoencoder-based CF algorithms have shown superior performance compared to linear MF methods. 
The first autoencoder-based recommendation algorithm, **<font color='red'>AutoRec</font>**, was proposed using vanilla autoencoders for collaborative filtering. Further research used denoising autoencoders to present **<font color='red'>CDAE</font>**. The most recent advancement, **<font color='red'>Variational Autoencoder for Collaborative Filtering (VAE-CF)</font>**, employed Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with stochastic latent variables and learned probability distributions per datapoint. 
The VAE-CF led to more robust representations and yielded state-of-the-art recommendation performance, beating other autoencoder and neural network-based methods. This approach was motivated by recent advances in computer vision using flexible VAE priors, such as the **<font color='red'>VampPrior</font>**. 
**Equations**

The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a probabilistic generative model that models the data distribution P(X) using amortized variational inference. The VAE-CF uses stochastic latent variables and learns their probability distributions per datapoint. 
$\mathbf{z} \sim Q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})$
$\theta \sim p_\theta(\theta)$
$P(x|z) = g(z)$

**Math**

where $\mathbf{z}$ is the latent variable, $Q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})$ is the variational distribution over the latent variables given an input $\mathbf{x}$, $\theta$ is a parameter, and $P(x|z)$ is the likelihood of observing an input $\mathbf{x}$ given a latent variable $\mathbf{z}$.

## 3 PRELIMINARIES

**Problem Formulation and Original Framework**

Our work extends the Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for Collaborative Filtering (CF) framework, incorporating ideas to enhance recommendation performance in collaborative filtering. The VAE-CF framework has been previously explored, but our extension aims to improve its effectiveness. 
We start by describing the problem formulation used in this work. In collaborative filtering, the goal is to recommend items to users based on their past interactions and preferences. However, traditional CF methods suffer from scalability issues and cold start problems. **<font color='red'>Our objective</font>** is to develop a framework that can efficiently leverage user-item interaction data to generate accurate recommendations. 
The original VAE-CF framework involves the use of a variational autoencoder to learn a latent representation of users and items. This representation captures their underlying patterns and relationships, allowing for more effective collaborative filtering. However, the **<font color='red'>novel contributions</font>** of our work aim to improve upon this foundation by introducing new ideas and techniques. 
Here's the LaTeX equation as per your request, however I couldn't find any equation in your content.

## 3.1 Problem Formulation

**User Preference Modeling**

We aim to model user preferences based on a given users' interaction history with an item set. A shared notation is used throughout this paper. Users are indexed using u ∈ {1,… ,N}, while items are indexed using i ∈ {1,… ,M}. Implicit feedback with binary input is considered, where the dataset X = {x1,…,xN} consists of each user's interaction history x_u ∈ IM and a latent variable z_u ∈ ℝD representing the user preference for user u. 
**Key Notations:**

- Users are indexed using u ∈ {1,… ,M}. - Items are indexed using i ∈ {1,… ,N}. - The dataset X = {x1,…,xN} represents each user's interaction history x_u ∈ IM. - The latent variable z_u ∈ ℝD represents the user preference for user u. 
**Mathematical Representation:**

The interaction history of user u is denoted as xu, where xui ∈ {0, 1} indicates whether user u has interacted with item i or not.

## 3.2 VAE for Collaborative Filtering

Here is the summarized version of the content in paragraphs:

The baseline model used in our research is the Multi-VAE. The generative process involves sampling a latent variable from a standard normal prior distribution for each user. This latent representation is then transformed through a neural network generative model to produce the probability distribution over the user's item consumption history. 
The multinomial distribution of the user's item consumption history can be represented mathematically as: 
<font color='red'>𝒛𝑢 ~ 𝑁(0, 𝐈_𝐃)</font>, <font color='red'>𝜋(𝒛𝑢) ∝ exp{𝑓_𝜃(𝒛𝑢)}</font>, and <font color='red'>𝒙𝑢 ~ 𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖(𝑁_𝑢, 𝜋(𝒛𝑢))</font>. 

Here is the LaTeX representation of equation (1):
\[ \mathbf{z}_u \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_D), \quad \pi(\mathbf{z}_u) \propto \exp\{f_\theta(\mathbf{z}_u)\}, \quad \mathbf{x}_u \sim Mult_i(N_u, \pi(\mathbf{z}_u)) \]

## 4 ENHANCING VAES FOR CF

**Variational Autoencoders for Collaborative Filtering**

Our work explores the application of flexible priors to variational autoencoders (VAEs) for collaborative filtering, a field where prior research has not been conducted. We aim to enhance VAEs for collaborative filtering using flexible priors and gating mechanisms. 
The standard Gaussian prior used in regular VAEs can be restrictive and result in an unintended strong regularization effect. In contrast, our approach employs a recently proposed flexible prior called the VampPrior (variational mixture of posteriors prior). This prior is an approximation to the optimal prior that maximizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) by solving the Lagrange function. 
We experiment with the VampPrior and find that it can improve the modeling performance of VAEs for collaborative filtering. Furthermore, we adopt hierarchical stochastic units to learn even richer latent representations. This approach has been explored in different literatures but not for collaborative filtering. The full Hierarchical Vamp-Prior VAE model is composed of a stacked hierarchical structure of two stochastic latent variables. 
Our work shows that flexible priors and gating mechanisms can improve the recommendation quality in the context of collaborative filtering, achieving better results than standard Gaussian priors.

## 4.2 Gating Mechanism

**Summary**

Researchers have used autoencoders for collaborative filtering with relatively shallow networks in previous studies [23, 30]. These models use en-encoder networks with no hidden layers. However, our anticipation is that the nature of the data and the ease of deepening autoencoder structure might be two possible reasons why adding more layers does not provide additional performance gain. One promising solution is to experiment with non-recurrent gating mechanisms like Gated CNNs [4], which can help propagate information from lower layers to higher ones. 
<font color='red'>The formula for the gated mechanism proposed in Gated CNNs is ℎ𝑙(𝑿) = (𝑿∗ 𝑾 + 𝒃) ⊗ 𝜎(𝑿∗ 𝑽 + 𝒄)</font>, where <font color='red'>the gates attend to the past layer and react depending on the current input</font>. This can potentially increase the network's modeling capacity to allow higher level interactions. 
<font color='red'>The use of gated linear units can help alleviate the issue of vanishing gradients in deeper networks</font>, which is a common problem when using non-recurrent neural nets. By incorporating this mechanism, we can experiment with deeper autoencoder structures and potentially improve performance.

## 5.1 Setup

**Summary**

The experiments were conducted on two large-scale datasets, MovieLens-20M and Netflix Prize, with implicit feedback considered by binarizing ratings of four or higher. Only users who watched at least five movies were kept for both datasets. Performance was evaluated using two ranking-based metrics: Recall@K and NDCG@K. The experiments were set up under the strong generalization setting, where all users were split into training/validation/test sets, and models were trained on the entire click history of the training set. 
**Important details in <font color='red'>**

<font color='red'>The experiments were conducted on MovieLens-20M and Netflix Prize datasets</font>, with ratings of four or higher considered for implicit feedback. Users who watched at least five movies were kept for both datasets. The performance was evaluated using Recall@K and NDCG@K metrics, which consider the ranking importance differently.

\[ \text{Recall@K} = \frac{\text{Number of relevant items ranked within top K}}{\text{Total number of relevant items}} \]

\[ \text{NDCG@K} = \sum_{i=1}^{K} \frac{2^{r_i} - 1}{\log_2(i + 1)} \]

## 5.2 Models

Here's a summary of the content in paragraphs, using LaTeX for equations, and applying font color restrictions:

We have chosen popular matrix factorization and state-of-the-art autoencoder models as baselines for comparison. Specifically, WMF [13], SLIM [19], CDAE [30], and Multi-VAE [15] are used as reference models. To evaluate the effect of flexible priors, HVAE, and gating mechanisms, we have developed several novel models. 
Our proposed models include Vamp: a variational autoencoder with a VampPrior [25] as the prior distribution, which can be compared to Multi-VAE [15] to assess the impact of using flexible priors. Additionally, we have H+Vamp: a hierarchical VAE [12, 25] with the VampPrior and hierarchical stochastic units to model the latent representation. 
Furthermore, our final model is H+Vamp (Gated), which applies additional gating mechanisms to the H+Vamp model using Gated Linear Units [4]. We also have Multi-VAE (Gated): a modified version of the original Multi-VAE [15] with gating mechanisms. All models are fully tuned by selecting optimal hyperparameters through grid search. 
The number of components K in the VampPrior was set to 1000. In contrast to previous suggestions that multinomial likelihoods may perform better than binary cross-entropy for CF, we found that this was not always the case and used the better of the two for each model/dataset. Results from WMF [13], SLIM [19], and CDAE [30] were taken from [15], ensuring fair comparison with our setup. 
Here are the most important results summarized in paragraphs:

* We have developed novel models, including Vamp, H+Vamp, and H+Vamp (Gated), to evaluate the effect of flexible priors and gating mechanisms. * <font color='red'>Our final model is H+Vamp (Gated)</font>, which applies additional gating mechanisms using Gated Linear Units [4]. * We have also explored Multi-VAE (Gated): a modified version of the original Multi-VAE [15] with gating mechanisms. * The number of components K in the VampPrior was set to 1000.

## 5.3 Results

Here is the summarized content in paragraphs:

We compared our proposed models with various baselines and examined the effect of gating mechanisms by comparing the performance of gated and ungated models of increasing depth. The results showed that <font color='red'>Multi-VAE [15] was the strongest baseline</font>, while Vamp, H+Vamp, and H+Vamp (Gated) showed sequentially improving performance. 
Our final model, H + Vamp (Gated), outperformed the strongest baseline Multi-VAE [15] for both datasets on all metrics. This model achieved up to 6.87% relative increase in recall@20 for the Netflix dataset, producing new state-of-the-art results. The effect of gating was also studied by comparing the performance of gated and ungated models with increasing depth. 
The results showed that <font color='red'>increasing the depth did not bring performance gain for ungated models</font>, while for gated models it led to better performance. This suggests that <font color='red'>gating does help the network to propagate information through deeper models</font>. Furthermore, large performance gains were observed by simply adding gates without additional layers, indicating that the higher-level interactions allowed by self-attentive gates are also beneficial for modeling user preferences. 
Here is the equation in LaTeX format:

$P(\text{recall@20}) = 1 - (6.87\%)^2$

And here is the summary of key points:

* Our final model, H + Vamp (Gated), outperformed the strongest baseline Multi-VAE [15] for both datasets on all metrics. * Gating helps the network to propagate information through deeper models. * Large performance gains were observed by simply adding gates without additional layers.

## 6 CONCLUSION

**Summary**

Our paper extends the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for collaborative filtering by introducing flexible priors and gating mechanisms. This extension allows the model to learn better representations of user preferences, improving its capacity. The standard Gaussian prior may limit the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data. 
<font color='red'>We demonstrate empirically that incorporating a more flexible prior can lead to improved results</font>. Additionally, we show that gating mechanisms are suitable for modeling user-item interaction data. These gates provide valuable capabilities, such as helping information propagate through deeper networks. Our final model, which combines Hierarchical VampPrior VAEs with Gated Linear Units (GLUs), achieves new state-of-the-art results in the collaborative filtering literature. 
**Mathematical Formulation**

The proposed model is based on the following equations:

$$
P(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}) = \int P(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}) P(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) d\mathbf{z}
$$

where $\mathbf{y}$ is the user preference, $\mathbf{x}$ is the item features, and $\mathbf{z}$ is the latent variable. The flexible prior $P(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})$ is introduced to improve the model capacity. 
$$
P(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) = \text{GLU}(h(\mathbf{x}), \phi)
$$

where $\text{GLU}$ is the Gated Linear Unit, $h(\mathbf{x})$ is the input feature, and $\phi$ is the learned parameter. The gating mechanism helps to propagate information through deeper networks. 
Our final model combines Hierarchical VampPrior VAEs with GLUs:

$$
P(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}) = \int P(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}) \text{GLU}(h(\mathbf{x}), \phi) d\mathbf{z}
$$
