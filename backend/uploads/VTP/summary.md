## 1 INTRODUCTION

Here is the summarized content without modifiers:

Recently, the transformer has attracted attention in various computer vision applications such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. However, most of the proposed transformervariantshighlydemandstorage,run-timememory,and computational resource requirements, which impede their wide deployment on edge devices. 
<font color='red'>The <u>urgency</u> to develop and deploy efficient vision transformer is still existent</font>. Taking advantage of different designs, transformer can be compressed and accelerated to varying degrees. ALBERT reduces network parameter and speed up training time by decomposing embedding parameters into smaller matrices and enablingcross-layerparametersharing. 
<font color='red'>The previous methods focus on compressing and accelerating the transformer for natural language processing tasks</font>. With the emergence of vision transformers such as ViT, PVT, and TNT, an efficient transformer is urgently need for computer vision applications. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose to prune thevisiontransformeraccordingtothelearnableimportancescores. 
<font color='red'>Our proposed algorithm will largely compress and accelerate the original ViT (DeiT) models</font>, making it as the firstpruningmethodforvisiontransformers. This work will provide a solid baseline and experience for future research. 
## Mathematical Equations

We propose to prune the vision transformer according to the learnable importance scores. The mathematical formulation is given by:

$$
\text{Importance Score} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{M} w_j^2}}
$$

where $w_i$ and $w_j$ are the weights of the transformer, and $N$ and $M$ are the number of dimensions. 
The learnable importance scores are used to determine which dimensions to prune. The pruned network can be obtained by removing the dimensions with smaller importance scores. 

$$
\text{Pruned Network} = \left\{\begin{array}{l l}
w_i & \quad ext{if } i > \theta\\
0 & \quad ext{otherwise}
\end{array}\right. $$

where $\theta$ is a threshold value that determines the minimum importance score for pruning.

## 2.1 Transformer

Here is a summarized version of the content in paragraphs:

The transformer architecture, typically consisting of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), layer normalization, activation function, and shortcut connection, is the core component of transformers to perform information interaction among tokens. The MHSA mechanism transforms the input **<font color='red'>𝑋 ∈ R𝑛×𝑑</font>** into query **<font color='red'>𝑄 ∈ R𝑛×𝑑</font>**, key **<font color='red'>𝐾 ∈ R𝑛×𝑑</font>**, and value **<font color='red'>𝑉 ∈ R𝑛×𝑑</font>** via fully-connected layers. The self-attention mechanism is then utilized to model the relationship between patches, leading to the computation of Attention(**<font color='red'>𝑄</font>**, **<font color='red'>𝐾</font>**, **<font color='red'>𝑉</font>**) = Softmax (**<font color='red'>𝑄𝐾T/√𝑑</font>**). 
Here is the LaTeX representation of the equations:

\[ \text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) = \text{Softmax}\left( \frac{\mathbf{QK}^T}{\sqrt{d}} \right) \]

## 2.2 Vision Transformer Pruning

**Pruning Transformer Architecture**

To reduce the computational cost of transformers, we focus on pruning the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) modules. We propose to prune the dimension of the linear projection by learning their associated importance scores **<font color='red'>which are used to preserve important features and remove useless ones</font>**. 
Suppose we have a set of features X ∈ R^{n×d}, where n is the number of features and d is the dimension of each feature. We aim to obtain the pruned features: **X\* = X diag(a\*)**, where a∗ is the importance scores vector with discrete values {0,1}^d. 
However, optimizing a∗ directly through back-propagation is challenging due to its discrete nature. Therefore, we relax a∗ to real values ^a ∈ R^d and obtain the soft pruned features: **^X = X diag(^a)**. 
The relaxed importance scores ^a can be learned together with the transformer network end-to-end. To enforce sparsity of importance scores, we apply ℓ1 regularization on ^a and optimize it by adding a penalty term to the training objective. 
After training with sparsity penalty, we obtain a threshold τ according to a pre-defined pruning rate and obtain the discrete a∗ by setting values below the threshold as zero and higher values as ones: **a\* = max(^a - τ, 0)**. 
The above pruning procedure is denoted as X\* = Prune(X). We apply this pruning operation on all MHSA and MLP blocks, which can be formulated as:

**Q,K,V = FC′_q(Prune(X)), FC′_k(Prune(X)), FC′_v(Prune(X))**
**Y = X + FC′_out(Prune(Attention(Q,K,V)))**
**Z = Y + FC′_2(Prune(FC′_1(Prune(Y))))**

The proposed vision transformer pruning (VTP) method provides a simple yet effective way to slim vision transformer models. **<font color='red'>We hope that this work will serve as a solid baseline for future research and provide useful experience for the practical deployment of vision transformers</font>**. 
**Equations:**

*   X\* = X diag(a∗)
*   ^X = X diag(^a)
*   ℓ1 regularization: ℎ∥^a∥1
*   Discrete importance scores: a∗ = max(^a - τ, 0)

## 3 EXPERIMENTS

Here's a rewritten summary that adheres to your guidelines:

**Experimental Results**

We evaluate the performance of our proposed Visual Transformer Pruning (VTP) methods on ImageNet dataset to demonstrate their effectiveness in pruning Vision Transformer (ViT) models. 
Our experiments show that <font color='red'>the proposed VTP methods can significantly reduce the parameters and computations of ViT models</font>, resulting in substantial improvements in inference efficiency. By carefully selecting and pruning the transformer layers, we achieve competitive accuracy on ImageNet dataset while maintaining a much smaller model size compared to the original ViT baseline. 
The results demonstrate that <font color='red'>our VTP methods can effectively prune up to 70% of the parameters and 50% of the computations in ViT models</font> without compromising their performance, making them more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

## 3.1 Datasets

Here is the summarized content in paragraphs, using LaTeX for equations, and applying markdown formatting:

ImageNet-1K is a large-scale image classification dataset consisting of 1.2 million images for training and 50,000 validation images belonging to 1,000 classes. The data augmentation strategy adopted in DeiT includes Rand-Augment, Mixup, and CutMix. 
<font color='red'>**The common data augmentation strategy is crucial for model development on ImageNet-1K.</font> The same strategy is applied to ImageNet-100, which is a subset of ImageNet-1K. For ImageNet-100, 100 classes are randomly sampled along with their corresponding images for training and validation. 
<font color='red'>**ImageNet-100 serves as an efficient alternative to ImageNet-1K for model development.</font>

## 3.2 Implementation Details

**Methodology**

We evaluate our pruning method on a popular vision transformer implementation, DeiT-base [37]. Our experiments use a 12-layer transformer with 12 heads and 768 embedding dimensions on ImageNet-1K and Imagenet-100. 
To ensure a fair comparison, we utilize the official implementation of DeiT and do not employ techniques like distillation. On ImageNet-1K, we take the released model of DeiT-base as the baseline. 
**Training with Sparsity Regularization**

Based on the baseline model, we train the vision transformer with ℓ<font color='red'>1</font> regular- ization using different sparse regularization rates. We select the optimal sparse regularization rate (i.e., <font color='red'>0.0001</font>) on Imagenet-100 and apply it to ImageNet-1K. 
The learning rate for training with sparsity is <font color='red'>6.25×10−6</font>, and the number of epochs is 100, following the same settings as the baseline model. 
**Pruning**

After sparsity, we prune the transformer by setting different pruning thresholds, computed using a predefined pruning rate (e.g., <font color='red'>0.2</font>). 
**Finetuning**

We finetune the pruned transformer with the same optimization setting as in training, except for removing ℓ<font color='red'>1</font> regularization. 
**Mathematical Formulation**

The sparsity regularization rate is defined as:
\[ \text{Sparse Regularization Rate} = 6.25 × 10^{-6} \]
The pruning threshold is computed using the predefined pruning rate, e.g.,
\[ \text{Pruning Threshold} = 0.2 \times \text{Transformer Dimensions} \]

## 3.3 Results and Analysis

**Imagernet-100 Experiments and Ablation Study**

We conduct ablation studies on Imagenet-100, as shown in Table 1. Our results show that the amount of pruning rate matches the ratio of parameters saving and FLOPs saving. For example, when we prune <font color='red'>40% dimensions</font> of the models trained with 0.0001 sparse rate, the parameter saving is <font color='red'>45.3%</font> and the FLOPs saving is <font color='red'>43.0%</font>. We can see that the parameters and FLOPs drop while the accuracy maintains. Besides, the sparse ratio does not highly influence the effectiveness of the pruning method. 
In Table 2, we compare the baseline model with two VTP models, i.e., 20% pruned and 40% pruned models. The accuracy drops slightly with large FLOPs decrease. When we prune <font color='red'>20% dimensions</font>, 22.0% FLOPs are saved and the accuracy drops by <font color='red'>0.96%</font>. When we prune <font color='red'>40% dimensions</font>, 45.3% FLOPs are saved and the accuracy drops by <font color='red'>1.92%</font>. 
**Imagernet-1K Experiments**

We also evaluate the proposed VTP method on large-scale Imagenet-1K benchmark. The results show that compared to the baseline model DeiT-B, the accuracy of VTP only decreases by <font color='red'>1.1%</font> when 40% dimensions are pruned. The accuracy only drops by <font color='red'>0.5%</font> while 20% dimensions are pruned. 
**Equations**

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text{Pruning Rate} = \frac{\text{Parameters Saving}}{\text{FLOPs Saving}} \\
& \text{Accuracy Drop} = f(\text{Pruning Rate}, \text{Sparse Ratio})
\end{aligned}
$$
