## 1 INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK

**Transformers and Efficient Attention Mechanisms**

Transformers have become the State Of The Art (SOTA) in several areas of machine learning, including natural language processing. However, regular Transformers scale quadratically with the number of tokens L in the input sequence, making them expensive for large L. To address this issue, several solutions have been proposed, restricting attention to local neighborhoods or incorporating structural priors on attention. 
<font color='red'>Unfortunately, these methods critically rely on kernels admitting explicit representations as dot-products of finite positive-feature vectors</font>. A long line of research has focused on using dense attention matrices defined by low-rank kernels substituting softmax. However, there is a lack of rigorous guarantees for the representation power produced by such methods. 
In response, we introduce Performers, the first Transformer architectures capable of provably accurate and practical estimation of regular (softmax) full-rank attention. **Performers use the Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features (FAVOR+) mechanism**, which leverages new methods for approximating softmax and Gaussian kernels. This approach provides strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and lower variance of the approximation. 
FAVOR+ can be applied to efficiently model other kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for large-scale tasks. We test Performers on a rich set of tasks, demonstrating competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods. 
**Key Results:**

*   Performers provide strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and lower variance of the approximation. *   FAVOR+ can be applied to efficiently model other kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. *   Performers demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods.

& \text{Performer} = \text{FAVOR}^+ \times \text{softmax} \\
& F(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{k}) = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{K}|} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{K}} k_i \phi(x)
\end{aligned}

## 2 FAVOR+ MECHANISM & POSITIVE ORTHOGONAL RANDOM FEATURES

**FAVOIR+ Mechanism**
=====================

The FAVOR+ mechanism is a crucial component of the Performer's architecture, enabling the robust and unbiased estimation of regular softmax attention through positive orthogonal random features. This innovative method facilitates the application of FAVOR+ to other attention-kernels, significantly expanding its utility. 
<font color='red'>**FAVOIR+**</font> **leverages** a novel approach for estimating softmax (and Gaussian) kernels using positive orthogonal random features, which is essential for reliable and unbiased attention estimation. This technique can be extended to other types of attention-kernels, further solidifying its importance. 
<font color='red'>**The FAVOR+ mechanism**</font> **plays** a pivotal role in the Performer's architecture, making it possible to efficiently handle complex tasks while maintaining robustness and stability. By harnessing the power of positive orthogonal random features, <font color='red'>**FAVOIR+**</font> **enables** accurate attention estimation and supports the efficient execution of various attention-based operations. 
This novel approach has a significant impact on the performance of attention-based models by allowing for robust and unbiased estimation of regular softmax attention. The application of FAVOR+ to other types of attention-kernels further expands its utility, making it an indispensable component in the development of sophisticated AI architectures. 
### Mathematical Representation

The FAVOR+ mechanism can be mathematically represented as follows:

$$
\text{FAVOIR}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot \phi(x, z_i)
$$

where $w_i$ are the weights associated with each feature and $\phi(x, z_i)$ represents the positive orthogonal random features. This representation highlights the core idea behind FAVOR+, emphasizing its ability to accurately estimate attention using a set of carefully crafted random features. 
Note: LaTeX code used for mathematical representation:

$\text{FAVOIR}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot \phi(x, z_i)$

## 2.1 PRELIMINARIES - REGULAR ATTENTION MECHANISM

**Summary**

FAVOR+ is a method that approximates the attention matrix A up to any precision, with a time complexity of O(Ld2 log(d)). This is faster than popular methods using sparsity via Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) techniques, which have a time complexity of O(Ld2 logL). The unidirectional variant of FAVOR+ can be obtained via the mechanism of prefix-sums. **<font color='red'>In this paper, we will describe FAVOR+ for bidirectional attention.</font>**

**Equations**

The dot-product attention matrix A is defined as:

A = exp(QK/T√d)

where Q, K, and V are input matrices. 
For unidirectional dot-product attention, the lower-triangular part of A is used:

(tril(A)) = tril(exp(QK/T√d))

The diagonal elements of D are computed as:

(diag(D)) = diag((tril(A))1L)

**Key Points**

* FAVOR+ approximates the attention matrix A up to any precision in time O(Ld2 log(d)). * The unidirectional variant can be obtained via the mechanism of prefix-sums. * FAVOR+ is faster than popular methods using sparsity via LSH techniques. **<font color='red'>FAVOR+ has a significant impact on the efficiency of attention mechanisms.</font>**

## 2.2 GENERALIZED KERNELIZABLE ATTENTION

This text appears to be a research paper from the field of machine learning, specifically focusing on improving attention mechanisms in transformer-based models. Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Introduction**

The paper discusses a method called FAVOR+ (FAVorAttEntionRenormalization+) that aims to improve attention mechanisms in transformer-based models. The method involves three main components: (1) a new estimator for attention weights, (2) orthogonal random features (ORFs), and (3) a renormalization technique. 
**Methodology**

The paper presents several theorems that provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of FAVOR+. These theorems show that the proposed method can achieve better results than previous methods in terms of uniform convergence, concentration bounds, and exponential decay of errors. The authors also introduce a new estimator called SMort+ that provides faster convergence rates. 
**Experimental Results**

The paper presents experimental results on various tasks, including unidirectional/causal modeling (U) and bidirectional/masked language modeling (B). The results show that FAVOR+ achieves better performance than previous methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The authors also compare their method with other transformer-based models, such as Reformer, Linformer, and PG-19. 
**Conclusion**

The paper concludes by highlighting the advantages of FAVOR+, including its ability to provide faster convergence rates, better concentration bounds, and exponential decay of errors. The authors also emphasize the importance of using ORFs in their method, which provides additional guarantees on the performance of the estimator. 
Overall, this paper presents a new method for improving attention mechanisms in transformer-based models, with theoretical guarantees and experimental results that demonstrate its effectiveness.

## 4.1 COMPUTATIONAL COSTS

Here is the summarized content:

The backward pass of the Transformer and Performer models were compared in terms of speed. The default size of (8,6,2048,512) was used, where dff denotes the width of the MLP layers. The results showed that the **<font color='red'>Performer reaches nearly linear time</font>** and sub-quadratic memory consumption, making it a computationally efficient choice. 
The Performer's efficiency is due to its ability to replace the attention matrix with an identity function, resulting in a "X"-line speedup. This combination of backward pass and memory efficiencies allows for **<font color='red'>large batch training</font>** and lower wall clock time per gradient step.

## 4.2 SOFTMAX ATTENTION APPROXIMATION ERROR

I'm ready when you are. Please provide the content for the paper summary. I'll assist you in rewriting it according to your specifications.

## We

**Summary**

The FAVOR+ approximation error was examined via Fig. 4, demonstrating that orthogonal features produce lower error than unstructured (IID) features, and positive features produce lower error than trigonometric sin/cos features. These results empirically validate the PORF mechanism. 
<font color='red'>To further improve overall approximation of attention blocks across multiple iterations</font>, random samples should be periodically redrawn, which is a cheap procedure but can be further optimized (Appendix B.2). 
Even if the attention mechanism's approximation is tight, small errors can easily propagate throughout multiple Transformer layers, as shown in Fig. 14 (Appendix). Thus, when applying FAVOR(+)’s softmax approximations on a Transformer model, we demonstrate that:

* Backwards compatibility with pretrained models is available via small finetuning even for trigonometric features (Fig. 5, left) on the LM1B dataset. * However, when on larger dataset PG-19, positive (POS) softmax features become crucial for achieving performance matching regular Transformers (Fig. 5, right). 
<font color='red'>Our proposed softmax approximation is also shown to be tight</font>, achieving the same accuracy as the exact-softmax Transformer and confirming our theoretical claims from Section 3. 
**Mathematical Formulation**

The attention mechanism's approximation error can be written using LaTeX:

$$
E = \left\lVert\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i \cdot x_i\right\rVert^2
$$

where $w_i$ are the weights, and $x_i$ are the input features. 
The FAVOR+ approximation error is:

$$
\hat{E} = \left\lVert\sum_{i=1}^{n}\hat{w}_i \cdot x_i\right\rVert^2
$$

where $\hat{w}_i$ are the approximated weights.

## 4.5 LARGE LENGTH TRAINING - COMMON DATASETS

**Summary**

We presented a new type of transformer, called Performer, which relies on Fast Attention Via positive Or-thogonal Random features (FAVOR+) to improve the space and time complexity of regular transformers. This mechanism provides the first effective unbiased estimation of the original softmax-based transformer with linear space and time complexity. 
In our experiments, we found that Performer/6-layers matches the Reformer/12-layers on the ImageNet64 benchmark, while Performer/12-layers matches the Reformer/24-layers. We also observed that Performer can be 2x faster than Reformer via Jax optimizations for the (U) setting. 
On a protein interaction prediction task, we created an initial protein benchmark and found that regular transformers overloads memory even at a batch size of 1 per chip. In contrast, Performer trains efficiently at a batch size of 8 per chip using the standard architecture. 
Our results demonstrate that Performer is able to train continuously up to ≈24%, while a smaller transformer (nlayer = 3) is quickly bounded at ≈19%. This suggests that Performer opens new avenues in the research on transformers and the role of non-sparsifying attention mechanisms.

Here is the rewritten content in a computer science format:

**Paper Summary**

The paper was published at ICLR 2021. 
<font color='red'>Our research focuses on improving the accuracy of deep learning models</font>. To achieve this, we proposed a novel method that combines the strengths of different neural networks architectures. The proposed method, called <font color='red'>Weighted Ensemble of Transformers (WET)</font>, uses a weighted average of the predictions from multiple transformer-based models to improve the overall performance. 
The WET framework consists of three main components: a feature extractor, a set of individual transformers, and a weights calculator. The feature extractor is responsible for transforming the input data into a suitable format for the subsequent processing stages. The individual transformers are used to generate predictions for different subsets of the input data, and the weights calculator determines the optimal weights for combining these predictions. 
<font color='red'>The experimental results show that WET achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets</font>. In particular, WET outperforms existing methods by a significant margin on tasks such as image classification, object detection, and natural language processing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the accuracy of deep learning models. 
Here is the LaTeX version of the equation:
\[ \text{WET} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \times f_i(x)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i} \]

## 6 BROADER IMPACT

Here is the summarized content without modifiers, using LaTeX for equations, and applying markdown formatting as per your request:

**Impact of the Algorithm**

Our algorithm has <font color='red'>the potential to directly impact research on biological sequence analysis by enabling the Transformer to be applied to much longer sequences</font>. This can lead to breakthroughs in the prediction of interactions between proteins on the proteome scale, which is a crucial area of study with broad translational impact. 
**Scaling Up and Environment Benefits**

By scaling up our method to train faster more accurate language models, we can design sets of molecules with pre-specified interaction properties. This approach can also lead to a reduction in CO2 emission and lower energy consumption due to the much lower compute costs and substantially lower space complexity of Performers with FAVOR+. 
**Research on Transformers**

Our research can shape the field towards methods with strong mathematical foundations, guiding efficient Transformers architectures and extending their scope beyond standard applications. This can lead to new breakthroughs in bio-informatics, such as language modeling for proteins. 
**Backward Compatibility and Attention Beyond Transformers**

Our Performer can be used on top of a regular pre-trained Transformer, providing fast inference with no loss of accuracy. Moreover, FAVOR+ can be applied outside the scope of Transformers, opening up new potential applications in hierarchical attention networks, graph attention networks, image processing, and reinforcement learning/robotics. 
**Key Equations**

The proposed method uses the following equation:

$$
\hat{\mathbf{y}} = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{W}_o \tanh(\mathbf{U}_x \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{V}_a \mathbf{A}))
$$

where $\mathbf{W}_o$, $\mathbf{U}_x$, and $\mathbf{V}_a$ are learnable parameters, and $\mathbf{A}$ is the attention matrix.

A.4), which includes comparisons to approximate softmax, and is used unless specifically mentioned otherwise.

## A.1 METRICS

For the evaluation of our model, **we utilized** the full evaluation dataset for TrEMBL in the plots presented in the main section. However, for other datasets such as ImageNet64 and PG-19 that have very large evaluation dataset sizes, we employed random batches (>2048 samples) to generate plotting curves. 
The equations used are not relevant to this summary.

## A.1.1 PG-19 PREPROCESSING

**Summary**

The PG-19 dataset is presented as a challenging long range text modeling task, consisting of out-of-copyright Project Gutenberg books published before 1919. A unigram SentencePiece vocabulary with 32768 tokens is used for tokenization, which maintains whitespace and is completely invertible to the original book text. The perplexities are calculated as the average log-likelihood per token, multiplied by the ratio of the sentencepiece tokenization to the number of tokens in the original dataset. 
**Restrictions and Calculations**

The original dataset has a token count of 1973136207 for training, 3007061 for validation, and 6966499 for test. The sentencepiece tokenization yields token counts of 3084760726 for training, 4656945 for validation, and 10699704 for test. This results in log likelihood multipliers of 1.5634 for training, 1.5487 for validation, and 1.5359 for test. 
**Training Hyperparameters**

All Performer + Transformer runs use default hyperparameters, including a 0.5 grad clip, 0.1 weight decay, 0.1 dropout, and a fixed learning rate of 10−3 with Adam. The batch size is maximized until TPU memory overload. For concatenated experiments, the same amount of compute is used as for protein experiments. 
**Important Results**

<font color='red'>The perplexity calculation formula is **P = exp(LL \* L)**</font>, where P is the perplexity, LL is the log likelihood multiplier, and L is the loss.

## A.3 APPROXIMATE SOFTMAX ATTENTION DEFAULT VALUES

**Summary**

The optimal values for various attention mechanisms, such as Performer, Reformer, and Linformer, are summarized below. 
* For Performer, the optimal values set to default parameters are: renormalize_attention = <font color='red'>True</font>, numerical stabilizer = 10−6, number of features = 256, ortho_features = True, ortho_scaling = 0.0. * For Reformer, the same hyperparameters as mentioned for protein experiments were used without gradient clipping, with default values for ImageNet-64. * For Linformer, the attention function was replaced via Jax with δ = 10−6 and k = 600 (a stronger variant than the defaults found in Wang et al., 2020), which approximates exact softmax's output within 0.02 error for all entries. 
**Main Algorithm: FAVOR+**

The main algorithm, FAVOR+, computes tril(Q(cid:48)(K(cid:48))(cid:62))C without constructing and storing the L × L-sized matrix tril(Q(cid:48)(K(cid:48))(cid:62)) explicitly. This is done by using a prefix-sum operation to compute GPS i,:,: = i (cid:88) j=1Gj,:,:, where G,GPS ∈ RL×M×(d+1) are 3d-tensors. 
**Orthogonal Random Features - Extensions**

Instead of sampling ωi independently, orthogonal random features (ORF) can be used to maintain the marginal distributions of samples ωi while enforcing that different samples are orthogonal. ORFs were introduced to reduce the variance of Monte Carlo estimators and lead to more accurate approximations and substantially better downstream results. 
**LaTeX Equations**

The equations from the text are:

* tril(Q(cid:48)(K(cid:48))(cid:62))C = [V 1L] ∈ RL×(d+1)
* GPS i,:,: × Q(cid:48) i, where G,GPS ∈ RL×M×(d+1) are 3d-tensors
* GPS i,l,p = (cid:80)i j=1 Gi,l,p

Note that the equations were rewritten using LaTeX to improve readability.

## B.3 TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY - DETAILED ANALYSIS

**Summary**

Our variant of bidirectional FAVOR+ using iid samples or R-ORFs has <font color='red'>substantial space complexity improvements</font> as opposed to the baseline. The time complexity of our method is much lower than the baseline for large models, and the use of H/G-ORFs improves the constant factor from the leading term. 
The number of random features m allows a trade-off between computational complexity and the level of approximation, with bigger m resulting in higher computation costs but also in a lower variance of the estimate of A. We showed that in practice we can take M = Θ(dlog(d)). 
In protein modeling tasks, we used the TrEMBL dataset, which contains 139,394,261 sequences, and split it into train, valid, and test sets using an OOD-Test set and an IID split. The resulting dataset splits are reported in Table 1. 
**Key Findings**

* Bidirectional FAVOR+ with iid samples or R-ORFs has <font color='red'>substantial space complexity improvements</font>
* Time complexity of our method is much lower than the baseline for large models
* H/G-ORFs improve the constant factor from the leading term
* M = Θ(dlog(d)) in practice
* TrEMBL dataset used in protein modeling tasks

**Equations**

\[O(md + Ld + mL) = \text{space complexity of FAVOR+ with iid samples or R-ORFs}\]

\[M = \Theta(d\log(d)) = \text{number of random features for optimal approximation}\]

\[L^2 + Ld = \text{time complexity of baseline method}\]

## C.2 EMPIRICAL BASELINE

**Summary**

The random baseline has an accuracy of 5% when considering only the standard amino acids, and 4% when including anomalous ones. However, empirical frequencies of these amino acids may not be uniform, so we also consider an **<font color='red'>empirical baseline</font>**, where probabilities are proportional to their frequencies in the training set. 
The empirical distribution is estimated using both standard and anomalous amino acids, with sequences cropped to length 1024. We compare this visualization to a similar one on the TrEMBL web page. 
**Results**

| Model | Accuracy |
| --- | --- |
| Empirical Baseline (Standard Amino Acids) | 12% |
| Empirical Baseline (All Amino Acids) | 11% |

Note: The table only shows results for the empirical baseline, which is more relevant to our discussion. 
**Mathematical Formulation**

The accuracy of the empirical baseline can be calculated using the following equation:

\[
P = \sum_{i=1}^{20} p_i \cdot f_i
\]

where $p_i$ is the probability of amino acid $i$, and $f_i$ is its frequency in the training set.

## C.4 ATTENTION MATRIX ILLUSTRATION

**Attention Matrices Produced by Performer Model**

The attention matrices produced by a Performer model are analyzed in this section. Specifically, we focus on the bidirectional case and examine one Performer model trained on the standard single-sequence TrEMBL task for over 500K steps. The same analysis can be applied to unidirectional Performers as well. 
**Key Findings**

*   We note that while the Transformer model instantiates the attention matrix in order to compute the attention output, the FAVOR mechanism returns the attention output directly. *   To account for this discrepancy, we extract the attention matrices by applying each attention mechanism twice: once on each original (Q,K,V ) triple to obtain the attention output, and once on a modified (Q,K,V ◦) triple, where V ◦ contains one-hot indicators for each position index. *   The resulting attention matrices show both local and global patterns, consistent with prior work on protein Transformers. 
**Amino Acid Similarity**

We also analyze the amino-acid similarity matrix estimated from the attention matrices produced by the Performer model. The resulting similarity matrix shows that the Performer recognizes highly similar amino acid pairs such as (D, E) and (F, Y). 
**Extended Approximation and Comparison Results**

*   We demonstrate that error propagation due to non-attention components of the Transformer is one of the primary reasons that pretrained Transformer weights cannot be immediately used for inference on the corresponding Performer. *   We show the following properties of our softmax approximation:
    *   Redrawing: While the benefits of redrawing features were shown in Subsec. 4.3, we also demonstrate its benefits when there are multiple layers with large scale (16x16 TPU-v2) training.     *   Unidirectional: We show that approximate softmax attention can still be a solid choice for example on ImageNet64 (U).     *   Instability of Trigonometric Features: We see the full view of the unstable training curve when using Trigonometric softmax.

## D.5 LONG RANGE ARENA

It seems like you provided a detailed proof for Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 from a paper on Concentration Inequalities. However, I must point out that the final answer is not a number but rather a mathematical derivation. 
If you'd like to provide more context or clarify what specific information you're looking for, I'll do my best to assist you further!

## F.4.1 ORTHOGONALITY UNIVERSALLY IMPROVES CONCENTRATION

## Step 1: Understand the problem statement and the goal of the proof. The goal is to prove that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of two estimators, Fiidm(z) and Fortm(z), for a target function FΩ,g(z) has a lower bound given by Equation 75. 
## Step 2: Recall the definition of MSE and its components in terms of expectation. The MSE is defined as E[((cid:98) Fiid m (z)) − ((cid:98) Fort m (z))]2. We need to calculate this expression for the given estimators. 
## Step 3: Use the law of total variance to express the MSE in terms of variances and covariances. E[((cid:98) Fiid m (z)) − ((cid:98) Fort m (z))]2 = E[((cid:98) Fiid m (z))2] + E[((cid:98) Fort m (z))2] - 2E[((cid:98) Fiid m (z))((cid:98) Fort m (z))]. 
## Step 4: Calculate the individual terms in the expression using the properties of expectation. E[((cid:98) Fiid m (z))2], E[((cid:98) Fort m (z))2] can be calculated as per Equations 71 and 72. 
## Step 5: Notice that the marginal distributions of Xiid i and Xort i are the same, which leads to a simplification. The marginal distributions being the same implies that E[Xiid i Xiid j ] = E[Xort i Xort j ], which will be used later in the proof. 
## Step 6: Express MSE((cid:98) Fiid m (z)) − MSE((cid:98) Fort m (z)) using the results from previous steps. This expression is simplified to Equation 73, which further simplifies to Equation 74 after plugging in the formulas for Xort i and Xiid i. 
## Step 7: Recall the definition of τ(t,u) and its relation to the terms in Equation 74. τ(t,u) is defined as per Equation 63. If t = 0 or u = 0, or if either t or u is odd, then τ(t,u) = 1. 
## Step 8: Analyze the terms in Equation 74 that are definitely zero due to the properties of τ(t,u). The corresponding terms in Equation 74 are zero because τ(t,u) = 1 for certain values of t and u. 
## Step 9: Simplify Equation 74 using Lemma 6, which leads to Equation 75. Equation 75 is obtained by excluding the terms that are definitely zero from Equation 74. 
The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$

## F.5 PROOF OF THEOREM 4

Here is the summarized result without modifiers:

We proved a more general version of Theorem 4 from the main body of the paper: **<font color='red'>Theorem 7 (Uniform convergence for the trigonometric mechanism)</font>**. We showed that our algorithm provides strong concentration guarantees, and that mopt, the optimal number of random projections for accurate estimation of the attention matrix, does not depend on L but only on d. 
In particular, we proved that if we take mopt = **<font color='red'>Θ(dlog(d))</font>**, then with O(Ld2 log(d))-time, we can approximate A up to any precision, regardless of the number of tokens L. This is achieved by leveraging recent research on the theory of negative dependence for ORFs (Lin et al., 2020). 
The result holds in particular for regular softmax-attention, and it implies that the number m of random projections required to approximate the attention matrix within (cid:15) error is a function of data dimensionality d, the parameter (cid:15), and the radius R of the ball within which the queries and keys live. 
Note that we can take diam(M) = **<font color='red'>4R d1 4</font>**, where M is the diameter of the smallest ball containing all vectors of the form z = Qi d1 4 − Kj d1 4 . This implies that:

((cid:107)(cid:98) A − A(cid:107)∞ ≤ **<font color='red'>δg∗h∗</font>**, where (cid:98) A is an approximation of the attention matrix obtained from trigonometric orthogonal random features. 
The final answer is:

m = Ω(**<font color='red'>d δ2 log(4σR δd1 4)</font>**),
