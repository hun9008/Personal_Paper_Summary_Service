## 1. Introduction

**Swin Transformer: A General-Purpose Backbone for Computer Vision**

The evolution of network architectures in natural language processing (NLP) has led researchers to investigate its adaptation to computer vision, where the Transformer has recently demonstrated promising results on certain tasks, specifically image classification and joint vision-language modeling. 
However, significant challenges arise when transferring its high performance in the language domain to the visual domain. One of these differences involves scale: unlike word tokens that serve as basic elements of processing in language Transformers, visual elements can vary substantially in scale, a problem that receives attention in tasks such as object detection. 
Another difference is the much higher resolution of pixels in images compared to words in passages of text, which poses computational complexity issues for Transformer-based models. To overcome these issues, we propose the Swin Transformer, a general-purpose backbone that constructs hierarchical feature maps and has linear computational complexity to image size. 
The proposed Swin Transformer achieves strong performance on recognition tasks of image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, outperforming ViT/DeiT and ResNe(X)t models significantly with similar latency. Its state-of-the-art results include a top-1 accuracy of 87.3% on ImageNet-1K image classification, 58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on the COCO test-dev set, and 53.5 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation. 
<font color='red'>The proposed Swin Transformer has much lower latency than the sliding window method yet is similar in modeling power.</font>

This unified architecture across computer vision and NLP could benefit both fields, facilitating joint modeling of visual and textual signals and deeper sharing of modeling knowledge from both domains.

## 2. Related Work

Here is a summarized version of the content without using # and *, and with LaTeX equations:

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been the standard network model in computer vision for several decades, but it was not until the introduction of AlexNet that the CNN became mainstream. Since then, deeper and more effective convolutional neural architectures have been proposed to further propel the deep learning wave in computer vision, such as VGG, GoogleNet, ResNet, DenseNet, HRNet, and EfficientNet. 
<font color='red'>However, these architectures still face challenges in terms of memory access and computational complexity.</font>

The strong potential of Transformer-like architectures for unified modeling between vision and language has been highlighted. Our work achieves strong performance on several basic visual recognition tasks, and we hope it will contribute to a modeling shift. 
<font color='red'>Self-attention based backbone architectures have also been explored in the NLP field.</font> However, their costly memory access causes actual latency to be significantly larger than that of convolutional networks. 
Instead of using sliding windows, we propose shifting windows between consecutive layers, allowing for more efficient implementation. Self-attention/Transformers can complement CNNs by providing the capability to encode distant dependencies or heterogeneous interactions. 
<font color='red'>The encoder-decoder design in Transformer has been applied for object detection and instance segmentation tasks.</font> Our work explores the adaptation of Transformers for basic visual feature extraction, which is complementary to these works. 
Most related to our work is the Vision Transformer (ViT) and its follow-ups. ViT directly applies a Transformer architecture on non-overlapping medium-sized image patches for image classification, achieving an impressive speed-accuracy trade-off compared to convolutional networks. 
<font color='red'>However, the architecture of ViT requires large-scale training datasets to perform well.</font> Our Swin Transformer architecture achieves the best speed-accuracy trade-off among these methods on image classification, even though our work focuses on general-purpose performance rather than specifically on classification. Our approach is both efficient and effective, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on both COCO object detection and ADE20K semantic segmentation. 
<font color='red'>Empirically, we find that shifting windows between consecutive layers allows for more efficient memory access.</font>

<font color='red'>The quadratic increase in complexity with image size is still a challenge in the Transformer architecture.</font> However, our approach operates locally and has proven beneficial in modeling high correlation in visual signals.

## 3.1. Overall Architecture

**Swin Transformer Architecture Overview**

The Swin Transformer architecture is presented in Figure 3, which illustrates the tiny version (Swin-T). The input RGB image is first split into non-overlapping patches by a patch splitting module, similar to ViT. Each patch is treated as a token and its feature is set as a concatenation of the raw pixel RGB values. A linear embedding layer projects this raw-valued feature to an arbitrary dimension (C). 
**Key Features**

Several Transformer blocks with modified self-attention computation are applied on these patch tokens, maintaining the number of tokens (H × W ). To produce a hierarchical representation, patch merging layers reduce the number of tokens by downsampling the resolution. The first stage applies Swin Transformer blocks for feature transformation with resolution kept at H × W . This procedure is repeated twice, as "Stage 2" and "Stage 3", with output resolutions of H × W and H × W , respectively. 
**Swin Transformer Block**

A Swin Transformer block consists of a shifted window based MSA module, followed by a 2-layer MLP with GELU non-linearity in between. A LayerNorm (LN) layer is applied before each MSA module and each MLP, and a residual connection is applied after each module. 
<font color='red'>The key components of the Swin Transformer architecture are:</font> the patch splitting module, <font color='red'>the modified self-attention computation in the Transformer blocks,</font> and <font color='red'>the hierarchical representation produced by the patch merging layers.</font>

## 3.2. Shifted Window based Self-Attention

**Efficient Modeling for Vision Problems**

The standard Transformer architecture and its adaptation for image classification both conduct global self-attention, leading to quadratic complexity. To address this issue, we propose computing self-attention within local windows, which are arranged in a non-overlapping manner. 
<font color='red'>Global self-attention computation is generally unaffordable for large images.</font> The window-based self-attention module lacks connections across windows, which limits its modeling power. To introduce cross-window connections while maintaining efficient computation, we propose a shifted window partitioning approach that alternates between two partitioning configurations in consecutive Swin Transformer blocks. 
<font color='red'>The shifted window partitioning approach introduces connections between neighboring non-overlapping windows.</font> This approach is found to be effective in image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. To efficiently compute the shifted configuration, we propose a cyclic-shift towards the top-left direction, which limits self-attention computation to within each sub-window. 
<font color='red'>The relative position bias significantly improves performance over counterparts without this bias term or that use absolute position embedding.</font>

**Equations**

Ω(MSA) = 4hwC2 + 2(hw)2C (1)
Ω(W-MSA) = 4hwC2 + 2M2hwC (2)

ˆ zl &= W-MSA(LN(zl-1)) + zl-1 \\
zl &= MLP(LN(ˆ zl)) + ˆ zl \\
ˆ zl+1 &= SW-MSA(LN(zl)) + zl \\
zl+1 &= MLP(LN(ˆ zl+1)) + ˆ zl+1 
\end{aligned}

## 3.3. Architecture Variants

Here's the summarized content:

We built a series of Swin models with varying sizes to compare with other architectures. Our base model, <font color='red'>Swin-B</font>, has a similar size and computation complexity to ViT-B/DeiT-B. We also introduced smaller versions, <font color='red'>Swin-T and Swin-S</font>, which are about 0.25× and 0.5× the model size and computational complexity of Swin-B respectively. The larger version, <font color='red'>Swin-L</font>, is 2× the model size and computational complexity. We set the window size to M = 7 by default and used a query dimension of d = 32 for each head. 
<font color='red'>The Swin models have similar complexities to ResNet-50 (DeiT-S) and ResNet-101</font>, making them suitable for various computer vision tasks. We set the expansion layer of each MLP to α = 4, and used a channel number of C for the hidden layers in the first stage. The table below shows the model size, theoretical computational complexity, and throughput of the Swin models on ImageNet image classification. 
**Table 1**
| Model | Size | FLOPs | Throughput |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Swin-B | - | - | - |

## 4. Experiments

We conduct experiments on ImageNet-1K image classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20K semantic segmentation. Our results show that the proposed <font color='red'>Swin Transformer architecture</font> outperforms previous state-of-the-arts on these tasks. 
In terms of **Computational Efficiency**, Swin Transformer achieves better performance with less computational cost than other models. We observe a significant improvement in **Model Performance** as well, with Swin Transformer achieving higher accuracy and lower error rates compared to existing methods. 
The key to our success lies in the novel **Hierarchical Structure** of Swin Transformer, which allows for efficient processing of images at multiple scales. This is achieved through a combination of **Cross-Attention Mechanisms** and **Shifted Windows**, which enable the model to capture long-range dependencies and local patterns simultaneously. 
Our experiments demonstrate that <font color='red'>Swin Transformer can be successfully ablated</font> by removing key design elements, such as the cross-attention mechanism or the shifted windows, while still maintaining a high level of performance. This suggests that Swin Transformer is a robust and efficient model for various vision tasks. 
\[L = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \log P(y_n)\]
where \(N\) is the total number of images, \(P(y_n)\) is the probability of correct classification for image \(n\), and \(y_n\) is the true class label.

## 4.1. Image Classification on ImageNet-1K

Here are the summarized results:

We evaluate the proposed Swin Transformer on the ImageNet-1K dataset <font color='red'>which contains 1.28M training images and 50K validation images from 1,000 classes</font>. The top-1 accuracy on a single crop is reported for two different training settings:

The first setting uses a standard data augmentation pipeline with random cropping, flipping, and color jittering. In contrast, the second setting employs a more aggressive data augmentation strategy, including mixup [20], cutmix [21], and auto-augmentation [22]. 
We use the following equation to compute the top-1 accuracy:

$$
\text{accuracy} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbbm{1}_{y_i = \hat{y}_i}}{N}
$$

where $y_i$ is the true label, $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted label, and $N$ is the number of test samples. 
The results show that the proposed Swin Transformer achieves state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K under both training settings.

Here are the summarized results without modifiers:

The proposed <font color='red'>Swin Transformer</font> surpasses the state-of-the-art Transformer-based architecture DeiT with similar complexities. Specifically, Swin-T achieves 81.3% top-1 accuracy, outperforming DeiT-S by +1.5%. Meanwhile, Swin-B and Swin-L models pre-trained on ImageNet-22K and fine-tuned on ImageNet-1K achieve 86.4% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy respectively. 
The Swin Transformer also achieves a slightly better speed-accuracy trade-off compared to state-of-the-art ConvNets, RegNet [48] and EfficientNet [58]. Notably, the ImageNet-22K pre-training brings significant gains over training on ImageNet-1K from scratch for both Swin-B (1.8%∼1.9%) and Swin-L (2.4%). 
Here are the equations written in LaTeX:

## 4.2. Object Detection on COCO

Here is a summarized version of the paper in paragraphs, with the most important words or sentences written in red, using LaTeX for equations, and avoiding markdown # and *:

The experiments conducted on COCO 2017 dataset involve object detection and instance segmentation tasks. An ablation study was performed using the validation set, and a system-level comparison was reported on test-dev. Four typical object detection frameworks were considered: Cascade Mask R-CNN [29, 6], ATSS [79], RepPoints v2 [12], and Sparse RCNN [56]. 
<font color='red'>For these four frameworks, we utilized the same settings:</font> multi-scale training [8, 56] (resizing the input such that the shorter side is between 480 and 800 while the longer side is at most 1333), AdamW [44] optimizer (initial learning rate of $0.0001$, weight decay of $0.05$, and batch size of $16$), and 3x schedule ($36$ epochs). 
<font color='red'>Our best model achieves 58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev, surpassing the previous best results by +2.7 box AP (Copy-paste [26] without external data) and +2.6 mask AP (DetectoRS [46])</font>. This is a significant improvement over the previous state-of-the-art models. 
The comparison to ResNe(X)t showed that our Swin Transformer brings consistent $+3.4∼4.2$ box AP gains over ResNet-50, with slightly larger model size, FLOPs and latency. Furthermore, Swin Transformer achieves a high detection accuracy of $51.9$ box AP and $45.0$ mask AP, which are significant gains of $+3.6$ box AP and $+3.3$ mask AP over ResNeXt101-64x4d. 
The comparison to DeiT showed that Swin-T achieves higher results than DeiT-S using the Cascade Mask R-CNN framework, with a difference of $+2.5$ box AP and $+2.3$ mask AP. The lower inference speed of DeiT is mainly due to its quadratic complexity to input image size. 
In conclusion, our proposed Swin Transformer architecture outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in object detection and instance segmentation tasks on COCO 2017 dataset.

## 4.3. Semantic Segmentation on ADE20K

Here is the summarized content:

ADE20K [83] is a widely-used semantic segmentation dataset covering 150 semantic categories with 25K images in total, split into training, validation, and testing sets. We employ UperNet as our base framework for its high efficiency. 
Our **<font color='red'>Swin-S model</font>** achieves remarkable results, outperforming DeiT-S by +5.3 mIoU (49.3 vs. 44.0) with similar computation cost. It also surpasses ResNet-101 and ResNeSt-101 [78] by +4.4 mIoU and +2.4 mIoU respectively. 
The **<font color='red'>best model</font>** on the val set is our Swin-L model with ImageNet-22K pre-training, achieving 53.5 mIoU and surpassing the previous best model by +3.2 mIoU (50.3 mIoU by SETR [81]). 
Equations and results:

\begin{align*}
mIoU & = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} TP_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} TP_i + FP_i}\\
FLOPs & = N \times M\\
FPS & = \frac{1}{FLOPs}
\end{align*}

where $TP_i$ is the true positive, $FP_i$ is the false positive, and $M$ is the model size.

## 4.4. Ablation Study

Here is a summarized version of the content, written in paragraphs and with LaTeX equations:

The ablation studies of the proposed Swin Transformer on three tasks - ImageNet-1K image classification, Cascade Mask R-CNN on COCO object detection, and UperNet on ADE20K semantic segmentation - are presented. The shifted window approach is found to be effective, as <font color='red'>Swin-T with shifted window partitioning outperforms its counterpart built on a single window partitioning at each stage by +1.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, +2.8 box AP/+2.2 mask AP on COCO, and +2.8 mIoU on ADE20K</font>. The results indicate that the shifted windows help to build connections among windows in the preceding layers. 
The relative position bias is also studied, and it is found that <font color='red'>Swin-T with relative position bias yields +1.2%/+0.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, +1.3/+1.5 box AP and +1.1/+1.3 mask AP on COCO</font>, compared to those without position encoding and with absolute position embedding. This indicates the effectiveness of the relative position bias. However, it is worth noting that <font color='red'>the inclusion of absolute position embedding improves image classification accuracy (+0.4%), but harms object detection and semantic segmentation (-0.2 box/mask AP on COCO and -0.6 mIoU on ADE20K)</font>. 
The self-attention computation methods are also compared, and it is found that <font color='red'>our cyclic implementation brings a 13%, 18% and 18% speed-up on Swin-T, Swin-S and Swin-B, respectively</font>. The self-attention modules built on the proposed shifted window approach are more efficient than those of sliding windows, with a speed-up factor of 4.1/1.5, 4.0/1.5, and 3.6/1.5 for Swin-T, Swin-S, and Swin-B, respectively. 
In summary, the ablation studies show that <font color='red'>the proposed shifted window based self-attention computation and the overall Swin Transformer architectures are slightly faster than Performer</font>, while achieving +2.3% top-1 accuracy compared to Performer on ImageNet-1K using Swin-T. 
Equations:

\begin{align*}

## A2.1. Image classification on ImageNet-1K

**Summary**

The image classification is performed by applying a global average pooling layer on the output feature map of the last stage, followed by a linear classifier. This strategy is as accurate as using an additional class token as in ViT [20] and DeiT [63]. In evaluation, the top-1 accuracy using a single crop is reported. 
We adopt a default input image resolution of 224x224 for all model variants. For other resolutions such as 384x384, we fine-tune the models trained at 224x224 resolution instead of training from scratch to reduce GPU consumption. 
During ImageNet-1K training, we employ an AdamW optimizer for 300 epochs using a cosine decay learning rate scheduler with 20 epochs of linear warm-up. A batch size of 1024, an initial learning rate of 0.001, a weight decay of 0.05, and gradient clipping with a max norm of 1 are used. 
We also pre-train on the larger ImageNet-22K dataset, which contains 14.2 million images and 22K classes. The training is done in two stages. In the first stage with 224x224 input, we employ an AdamW optimizer for 90 epochs using a linear decay learning rate scheduler with a 5-epoch linear warm-up. 
<font color='red'>The most important findings are that our strategy is as accurate as using an additional class token, and that fine-tuning on larger resolutions reduces GPU consumption</font>.

## A2.2. Object detection on COCO

For a comprehensive ablation study, we have considered four typical object detection frameworks: <font color='red'>Cascade Mask R-CNN</font>, ATSS, RepPoints v2, and Sparse RCNN in mmdetection. We utilize the same settings across these four frameworks, which include multi-scale training, AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.0001 and weight decay of 0.05, and a batch size of 16. 
Additionally, for system-level comparison, we adopt an improved HTC (denoted as HTC++) that incorporates instaboost, stronger multi-scale training, a 6x schedule with the learning rate decayed at epochs 63 and 69 by a factor of 0.1, soft-NMS, and an extra global self-attention layer appended at the output of the last stage. We also use ImageNet-22K pre-trained models as initialization for these frameworks. 
The specific configurations are:
- Multi-scale training settings:
  - Cascade Mask R-CNN: shorter side between 480 and 800 while the longer side is at most 1333
  - ATSS, RepPoints v2, Sparse RCNN: same as above
- Optimizer and scheduler for all models:
  - AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.0001, weight decay of 0.05, and batch size of 16
  - 3x schedule (36 epochs with the learning rate decayed by 10× at epochs 27 and 33)
- System-level comparison (HTC++):
  - Resizing input: shorter side between 400 and 1400 while the longer side is at most 1600
  - Schedule: 72 epochs with the learning rate decayed at epochs 63 and 69 by a factor of 0.1
  - Additional layers: soft-NMS, extra global self-attention layer appended at the output of last stage, ImageNet-22K pre-trained model as initialization

<font color='red'>These settings enable us to conduct a thorough comparison across different frameworks.</font>

## A2.3. Semantic segmentation on ADE20K

**Summary**

The ADE20K dataset is utilized, which covers a broad range of 150 semantic categories with 25K images in total. The UperNet framework is employed as the base model due to its high efficiency. In training, the AdamW optimizer is used with an initial learning rate of <font color='red'>6 × 10−5</font> and a weight decay of 0.01. Models are trained on 8 GPUs for 160K iterations. 
Augmentations such as random horizontal flipping, re-scaling within ratio range [0.5, 2.0], and photometric distortion are applied. Stochastic depth with a ratio of 0.2 is used for all Swin Transformer models. In inference, multi-scale testing using resolutions between <font color='red'>[0.5, 1.75]×</font> that in training is employed. 
**Equations**

\[

\]

where $lr_{decay}$ is the decayed learning rate, $lr$ is the initial learning rate, $t$ is the current iteration, ${iter_{max}}$ is the maximum number of iterations, and $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter.

If you're ready to proceed, please go ahead and provide the content, and I'll get started on summarizing and formatting it for you!

## A3.1. Image classification with different input size

**Swin Transformer Performance**

The performance of Swin Transformers is influenced by the input image size, as shown in Table 8. As the input resolution increases from 224x224 to 384x384, the model's top-1 accuracy improves while its inference speed slows down. 
The key takeaway is that **<font color='red'>higher input resolutions result in better performance</font>**, but at the cost of increased computational time.

## A3.2.DifferentOptimizersforResNe(X)tonCOCO

**Summary**

The performance of AdamW and SGD optimizers is evaluated on the ResNe(X)t backbones in the context of COCO object detection using the Cascade Mask R-CNN framework. We observe that replacing the default SGD optimizer with AdamW leads to improved accuracy, especially for smaller backbones. 
In our experiment, we **<font color='red'>used AdamW instead of SGD</font>** when comparing ResNe(X)t backbones to the proposed Swin Transformer architectures. This change results in better performance for the smaller backbones. The specific comparison is shown in Table 9:

$$
\text{Accuracy} = \text{AdamW} > \text{SGD}
$$

The use of AdamW leads to **<font color='red'>improved accuracy</font>**, particularly for the ResNe(X)t backbones, which are smaller compared to other architectures.

## A3.3. Swin MLP-Mixer

Here is the summarized content without markdown formatting, using LaTeX for equations, and applying font color restrictions:

The performance of Swin-Mixer is compared to the original MLP-Mixer architectures and a follow-up attempt, as shown in Table 10. The results demonstrate that Swin-Mixer achieves better performance than its counterparts. 
Equation of Swin-Mixer:
$$
\text{Swin-Mixer} = \text{Hierarchical Design} + \text{Shifted Window Approach}
$$

Key takeaways:

*   <font color='red'>The proposed architecture outperforms existing methods</font>. *   The shifted window approach and hierarchical design lead to improved performance. 
Note: LaTeX equations are used to represent the Swin-Mixer equation.

**Swin-Mixer vs. MLP-Mixer vs. ResMLP Comparison**

The Swin-Mixer approach outperforms both MLP-Mixer and ResMLP in terms of accuracy, with a significant improvement of 4.9% over the latter (81.3% vs. 76.4%). This is achieved while maintaining a slightly smaller computation budget compared to MLP-Mixer (10.4G vs. 12.7G). Additionally, Swin-Mixer has a better speed-accuracy trade-off compared to ResMLP. 
The proposed hierarchical design and shifted window approach in Swin-Mixer are generalizable, as demonstrated by its superior performance over existing models. This suggests that the combination of these architectural elements is a key factor in achieving state-of-the-art results in image recognition tasks. As a result, Swin-Mixer becomes a strong contender in the field of computer vision. 
<font color='red'>The results indicate that Swin-Mixer is a more effective and efficient approach than its counterparts.</font>

**Mathematical Representations**

Let's consider a simple mathematical representation of the comparison:

\[ \text{Accuracy}_{Swin} > \text{Accuracy}_{MLP} > \text{Accuracy}_{ResMLP} \]

where \( \text{Accuracy}_{i} \) represents the accuracy of model \( i \). 
The computation budget can be represented as:

\[ C_{Swin} < C_{MLP} \]

where \( C_i \) is the computation cost for model \( i \).
