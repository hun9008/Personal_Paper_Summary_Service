## 1 INTRODUCTION

Here is the summarized result in paragraphs:

Matrix factorization (MF) has become the industry standard as the foundation of recommender systems based on collaborative filtering <font color='red'>However, this family of models suffers from several issues.</font>. The number of parameters in any matrix factorization model is huge, leading to slow model learning and overfitting. Additionally, making predictions for new users/items requires running an optimization procedure, which can be computationally expensive. 
Recently proposed models such as the Collaborative Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) have partially addressed these issues by using a parameterized function that maps user feedback to user embeddings <font color='red'>and performs regularization in an alternative way.</font>. However, these models still have limitations. In this work, we propose the Recommender VAE (RecVAE) model for collaborative filtering with implicit feedback based on the variational autoencoder (VAE). 
The RecVAE model presents several novelties that improve performance. We designed a new architecture for the encoder network and introduced a novel composite prior distribution for the latent code z in the variational autoencoder <font color='red'>which improves training stability and performance.</font>. We also developed a new approach to setting the hyperparameter β for the Kullback-Leibler term in the objective function, which depends on the amount of data available for a given user. 
The RecVAE model is trained by alternating updates for the encoder and decoder <font color='red'>which allows for multiple updates of the encoder for every update of the decoder.</font>. This approach has several advantages, including improved stability and performance. As a result, our model significantly outperforms all autoencoder-based previous works and shows competitive or better results in comparison with other models across various collaborative filtering datasets. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews crucial components and approaches, while Section 3 describes the basic Mult-VAE approach and our modifications. Section 4 contains the results of a comprehensive experimental study, and Section 5 concludes the paper <font color='red'>which demonstrates the effectiveness of our model.</font>.

**Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**

The VAE is a deep latent variable model that learns complex distributions. The marginal likelihood function can be expressed via a latent code z as pθ(x) = ∫ pθ(x|z)p(z)dz, but it is intractable and usually approximated with the evidence lower bound (ELBO): <font color='red'>logpθ(x) ≥ LVAE = Eqϕ(z|x) logpθ(x|z)−KL qϕ(z|x)(cid:13) (cid:13)p(z)(cid:17)(cid:105)</font> (1)

This technique, known as amortized inference, provides additional regularization and allows to obtain variational parameters with a closed form function. Variational autoencoders can be used not only as generative models but also for representation learning. 
**β-VAE**

β-VAE is a modification of VAE designed to learn disentangled representations by adding a regularization coefficient to the Kullback-Leibler term in the evidence lower bound. The objective function of β-VAE can be considered as a valid ELBO with additional approximate posterior regularization: <font color='red'>Lβ-VAE = Eqϕ(z|x) logpθ(x|z)− βKL qϕ(z|x)(cid:13) (cid:13)p(z)(cid:17)(cid:105)</font> (2)

**Denoising Variational Autoencoders (DVAE)**

Denoising variational autoencoders are trying to reconstruct the input from its corrupted version. The ELBO in this model is defined as <font color='red'>logpθ(x) ≥ LDVAE = Eqϕ(z|˜ x)Ep(˜ x|x) logpθ(x|z)−KL qϕ(z|˜ x)(cid:13) (cid:13)p(z)(cid:17)(cid:105)</font> (3)

**Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)**

The Conditional Variational Autoencoder is another VAE extension which is able to learn complex conditional distributions. Its ELBO is as follows: <font color='red'>logpθ(x|y) ≥ LCVAE = Eqϕ(z|x,y) logpθ(x|z,y)−KL qϕ(z|x,y)(cid:13) (cid:13)pθ(z,y)(cid:17)(cid:105)</font> (4)

**VAE with Arbitrary Conditioning (VAEAC)**

VAEAC solves the imputation problem for missing features and has an ELBO similar to CVAE where the variable are the unobserved features xb and the condition is x1−b. However, this approach cannot be directly applied to the implicit feedback case. 
Equations:

(1) $\boxed{logpθ(x) ≥ LVAE = Eqϕ(z|x) logpθ(x|z)−KL qϕ(z|x)(cid:13) (cid:13)p(z)(cid:17)(cid:105)}$
(2) $\boxed{Lβ-VAE = Eqϕ(z|x) logpθ(x|z)− βKL qϕ(z|x)(cid:13) (cid:13)p(z)(cid:17)(cid:105)}$
(3) $\boxed{logpθ(x) ≥ LDVAE = Eqϕ(z|˜ x)Ep(˜ x|x) logpθ(x|z)−KL qϕ(z|˜ x)(cid:13) (cid:13)p(z)(cid:17)(cid:105)}$
(4) $\boxed{logpθ(x|y) ≥ LCVAE = Eqϕ(z|x,y) logpθ(x|z,y)−KL qϕ(z|x,y)(cid:13) (cid:13)pθ(z,y)(cid:17)(cid:105)}$

## Collaborative Filtering

Here are the summarized results:

The Collaborative Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) model is a type of neural network that reconstructs user feedback vectors from their corrupted versions. The encoder maps the corrupted vector to a hidden state, while the decoder uses this state to generate a reconstructed feedback vector. **<font color='red'>Both encoder and decoder are single neural layers, with shared weights across users.</font>**

The CDAE model is based on two equations: <span>$\mathbf{z}_u = \sigma(\mathbf{W}^T \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_u + \mathbf{V}_u + \mathbf{b})$</span>, where $\mathbf{z}_u$ is the latent representation, and <span>$\hat{\mathbf{x}}_u = \sigma(\mathbf{W}'\mathbf{z}_u + \mathbf{b}')$</span>, where $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_u$ is the reconstructed feedback vector. 
Regularization plays a crucial role in collaborative filtering, and CDAE uses amortized regularization of user embeddings coupled with denoising. **<font color='red'>This approach helps to prevent overfitting and improve model generalizability.</font>**

The Multinomial VAE (Mult-VAE) is a closely related work that extends variational autoencoders for collaborative filtering with implicit feedback. Our novel contributions will be presented in the next section.

## 3 PROPOSED APPROACH

However, I don't see any content to work with. Could you please provide the text that needs to be summarized and formatted according to your requirements?

## 3.1 Mult-VAE

**Summary**

The Mult-VAE model proposes a novel approach to VAE by using a multi-nomial distribution as the likelihood function instead of Gaussian and Bernoulli distributions commonly used in VAE. The generative model samples a k-dimensional latent representation <font color='red'>zu</font> for a user u, transforms it with a function fθ : Rk → R|I| parameterized by θ, and then draws the feedback history xu of user u from the multinomial distribution. 
<font color='red'>The flexibility of Mult-VAE comes from parameterizing f with a neural network with parameters θ</font>. To estimate θ, one has to approximate the intractable posterior p(zu | xu), which is done by constructing an evidence lower bound for the variational approximation. The resulting ELBO follows the general VAE structure with an additional hyperparameter β that allows achieving a better balance between latent code independence and reconstruction accuracy. 
<font color='red'>The likelihood pθ(xu|zu) in the ELBO of Mult-VAE is multino-mial distribution</font>, which is calculated as the logarithm of multinomial likelihood for a single user u: logMult(xu|nu,pu) = ∑ i xui logpui + Cu. 
**Mathematical Equations**

Equation (8): $zu \sim N(0,I), π(zu) = softmax(fθ(zu))$

Equation (9): $xu \sim Mult(nu,π(zu))$

Equation (11): $\logMult(xu|nu,pu) = \sum i xui \log pui + Cu$

## 3.2 Model Architecture

**Model Description**

Our proposed model is inherited from Mult-VAE with some architecture changes. The general architecture of our model reflects novelties discussed below. We move to a denoising variational autoencoder, changing the ELBO to <font color='red'>LLmult-vae = Eqϕ(zu|˜xu)Ep(˜xu|xu)(cid:104)logpθ(xu|zu)− −βKL (cid:16)qϕ(zu|xu)(cid:13) (cid:13)p(zu)(cid:17)(cid:105)</font> . This change is motivated by the fact that the original paper compares Mult-VAE with Mult-DAE, a denoising autoencoder that applies Bernoulli-based noise to the input but does not have the VAE structure. 
**Denoising Autoencoder**

We use the same noise distribution p(˜x|x) as elementwise multiplication of the vector x by a vector of Bernoulli random variables parameterized by their mean µnoise. This forces the model not only to reconstruct the input vector but also to predict unobserved feedback. 
**Inference Network**

Our proposed architecture for the inference network uses densely connected layers from dense CNNs, swish activation functions, and layer normalization. The decodernetworkisasimplelinearlayerwithsoftmaxactivation. 
**Key Equations**

The key equations of our model are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
LLmult-vae &= Eqϕ(zu|˜xu)Ep(˜xu|xu)(cid:104)logpθ(xu|zu)- βKL qϕ(zu|xu)p(zu)
\end{aligned} 
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
pθ(xu|zu) &= Mult(x|nu,π(zu))
\end{aligned} 
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
π(zu) &= softmax(fθ(zu))
\end{aligned} 
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
fθ(zu) &= Wzu +b
\end{aligned} 
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
qϕ(zu|xu) &= N(zu|ψϕ(xu))
\end{aligned} 
$$


## 3.3 Composite prior

**Summary**

In this work, we address the issue of instability during training of Mult-VAE due to posterior updates that may hurt variational parameters corresponding to other parts of the data. To regularize learning and prevent "forgetting" effects, we propose a composite prior distribution <font color='red'>that combines a standard Gaussian prior with an approximate posterior</font>. This composite prior is defined as p(z|ϕold,x) = αN(z|0,I)+(1−α)qϕold(z|x), where ϕold are the parameters from the previous epoch. The second term of this distribution regulates large steps during variational parameter optimization, while the first term prevents overfitting. 
**Key Results**

The proposed composite prior works better than a standard Gaussian prior and an additional regularization term in the form of KL divergence between the new and old parameter distributions. This approach is not equivalent to using a Gaussian prior and a separate KL regularizer that pulls current variational parameters to their previous values. The use of trainable and/or complex prior distributions, as proposed by other works, does not bring any improvements compared to our composite prior. Additionally, our model can be viewed as a conditional variational autoencoder where the approximate posterior and likelihood are conditionally independent of variational parameters from the previous epoch. 
**Mathematical Representation**

The composite prior distribution is represented mathematically as:

$$
p(z|\phi_{old}, x) = \alpha N(z|0, I) + (1 - \alpha)q_{\phi_{old}}(z|x)
$$

where $\alpha$ is a convex combination coefficient that lies in the range $[0, 1]$.

## 3.4 Rescaling KL divergence

**Summary**

In this work, we address the issue of choosing or changing the value of β in the β-VAE framework, which is crucial for the performance of Mult-VAE and RecVAE. We propose to keep the scale factor fixed and instead use an alternative view on KL divergence rescaling. We also introduce a new approach where the β constant is proportional to the amount of feedback available for the current user, |Xo u|. This modification leads to significant improvements in our experiments. 
**Main Contributions**

* **<font color='red'>We propose to keep the scale factor fixed</font>**, which makes it easier to find the optimal value for this hyperparameter. * **<font color='red'>We introduce a new approach where β is proportional to the amount of feedback available for the current user, |Xo u|</font>**. * **<font color='red'>This modification leads to significant improvements in our experiments</font>**. 
**Mathematical Formulation**

The evidence lower bound (ELBO) of a variational autoencoder can be rewritten as:

$L \approx \frac{1}{\gamma |Xo u|} E_{qϕ(zu|xu)} \left[ \logMult(xu|π(zu)) - γ |Xo u| KLf u \right]$

where $L$ is the ELBO, $\gamma$ is a constant hyperparameter shared across all users, and $KLu$ is the KL divergence between the posterior distribution and the prior distribution. 
We also introduce a new scaling factor, $β' = β'(xu) = γ |Xo u|$, which works better in practice.

## Denoising

Here is the summarized content in paragraphs without markdown modifiers and LaTeX equations:

The Alternating Least Squares (ALS) technique is a popular method for matrix factorization. In our model, we train user and item embeddings alternately, with user embeddings amortized by the inference network, while each item embedding is trained individually. 
This separation of parameters allows us to update the encoder network and decoder separately, with multiple updates of the encoder corresponding to one update of the decoder. This training procedure enables another improvement in performance. 
We have found that it is necessary to reconstruct corrupted input data using denoising autoencoders in autoencoder-based collaborative filtering. However, our experiments show that if we do not corrupt input data during the training of the decoder, and leave the denoising purely for the encoder, performance improves. This suggests that decoder parameters are overregularized. 
Thus, we propose to train the decoder as part of a basic vanilla Variational Autoencoder (VAE), with no denoising applied. In contrast, the encoder is trained as part of the denoising variational autoencoder. 
Here are some key points summarized in paragraphs:

* <font color='red'>We propose to update the encoder network and decoder separately</font>, with multiple updates of the encoder corresponding to one update of the decoder. * The reconstruction of corrupted input data using denoising autoencoders is necessary in autoencoder-based collaborative filtering, but this may lead to overregularization of decoder parameters. * <font color='red'>Training the decoder as part of a basic vanilla VAE without denoising improves performance</font>. * The encoder is trained as part of the denoising variational autoencoder. 
Now I'll replace the sentences starting with `<font color='red'>` with their LaTeX equivalent:

<font color='red'>We propose to update the encoder network and decoder separately</font> $\implies$ We propose to update the encoder network and decoder separately

<font color='red'>Training the decoder as part of a basic vanilla VAE without denoising improves performance</font> $\implies$ Training the decoder as part of a basic vanilla VAE without denoising improves performance

## 3.6 Summary

**Summary**

Our model's ELBO (Evidence Lower BOund) is given by the equation: L = Eq(˜x|x)logpθ(x|z)−β′(x)KL(qϕ(z|˜x)(p(z|ϕold,x)), where p(z|ϕold,x) is a conditional prior distribution and β′(x) is a modified weight. To train the decoder, we use a modified objective function Ldec = Eqϕ(z|x)logpθ(x|z), skipping the KL term since it doesn't depend on θ. 
<font color='red'>The model uses alternating updates with different parameters for encoder and decoder.</font> During training, we approximate inner and outer expectation by single Monte-Carlo samples and use reparametrization to compute z(∗) = д(ϵ,µ,σ), where ϵ ∼ N(0,I). We also use Monte-Carlo sampling for log likelihood and KL divergence. 
<font color='red'>The dropout layer serves as a noising mechanism.</font> The model uses multinomial likelihood, making classification cross-entropy the main component of the loss function. To make predictions for unseen users, we predict user embeddings with the inference network z = ψϕ(x) and then predict top items using the trained decoder. 
**Equations**

L = Eq(˜x|x)logpθ(x|z)−β′(x)KL(qϕ(z|˜x)(p(z|ϕold,x))

Ldec = Eqϕ(z|x)logpθ(x|z)

q(z|˜x) = ψϕ(x)

z(∗) = д(ϵ,µ,σ), where ϵ ∼ N(0,I)

d(ϵ, µ, σ) = ϵ · µ + σ

[µ, log σ²] = ψϕ(x)

˜x = x ⊙ m (noised input, m ∼ Bernoulli(µnoise))

However, it seems that there's no provided "Content" for me to work with yet. 
Please provide the content you'd like me to assist you with. I'll make sure to summarize it using paragraphs as much as possible, apply LaTeX formatting where necessary, and use red text for important words or sentences while following the given restrictions.

## 4.1 Metrics

Here's the summarized content in paragraphs without markdown formatting and with LaTeX equations:

We evaluate the models using information retrieval metrics for ranking quality: Recall@k and NDCG@k. These metrics compare top-k predictions of a model with the test set Xt u of user feedback for user u. 
The items are sorted in descending order of the likelihood predicted by the decoder, with items from the training set excluded. The item at the nth place in the resulting list is denoted as R(n) u . Evaluation metrics for a user u are defined as follows:

Recall@k(u) = <font color='red'>1 / min(M, |Xt u|)</font> k (cid:213) n=11 (cid:104)R(n) u ∈ Xt u(cid:105)

where 1[·] denotes the indicator function. The DCG@k(u) and NDCG@k(u) metrics are then defined as:

\[ \text{DCG}@k(u) = k \sum_{n=1}^{k} \frac{1}{\log(n+1)} [R(n) u \in Xt u] \]

and

\[ \text{NDCG}@k(u) = \left( \sum_{n=1}^{|Xt u|} \frac{1}{\log(n+1)} \right)^{-1} \text{DCG}@k(u) \]

Note that Recall@k accounts for all top-k items equally, while NDCG@k assigns larger weights to top-ranked items.

## 4.2 Datasets

**Summary**

We have evaluated the RecVAE model on three datasets: MovieLens-20M, Netflix Prize Dataset, and Million Songs Dataset. The datasets were preprocessed using the Mult-VAE approach, resulting in the following statistics:

* **MovieLens-20M**: 9,990,682 ratings on 20,720 movies from 136,677 users
* **Netflix Prize Dataset**: 56,880,037 ratings on 17,769 movies from 463,435 users
* **Million Songs Dataset**: 33,633,450 ratings on 41,140 songs from 571,355 users

To evaluate the model on unavailable users during training, we held out 10,000, 40,000, and 50,000 users for validation and testing on MovieLens-20M, Netflix Prize, and Million Songs Dataset, respectively. We used 80% of the ratings in the test set to compute user embeddings and evaluated the model on the remaining 20% of the ratings. 
**Key Findings**

* The RecVAE model was evaluated on three datasets: MovieLens-20M, Netflix Prize Dataset, and Million Songs Dataset. * The datasets were preprocessed using the Mult-VAE approach, resulting in large statistics for each dataset. * The model was evaluated on unavailable users during training, with 10,000, 40,000, and 50,000 users held out for validation and testing on MovieLens-20M, Netflix Prize, and Million Songs Dataset, respectively.

## 4.3 Baselines

Here is the summarized content:

The proposed model is compared with several baselines, which can be categorized into three groups: **<font color='red'>linear models</font>**, **learning to rank methods**, and **autoencoder-based methods**. In the first group, classical collaborative filtering methods such as Weighted Matrix Factorization (WMF) are used. WMF binarizes implicit feedback by setting **<font color='red'>positive interactions</font>** as 1 and decomposes the matrix similar to SVD but with confidence weights that increase with the number of positive interactions. 
In the second group, learning to rank methods such as WARP and LambdaNet are used. These methods allow for objective functions that are either flat or discontinuous. The third group includes autoencoder-based methods such as CDAE, Mult-DAE, and Mult-VAE. The proposed RecVAE model can also be considered as a member of this group. 
The performance of the proposed model is compared with these baselines in terms of scores for recommendation ranking. The scores are taken from existing literature and are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model.

## 4.4 Evaluation setup

The study employed RecVAE with an Adam optimizer, learning rate of 5 × 10^−4, and batch size of 500. The Mdec strategy selected each dataset element once per epoch, while µnoise was set to 0.5 and Menc to 3Mdec. A composite prior combining standard normal distribution, old posterior, and a normal distribution with zero mean and logσ2 = <font color='red'>10</font> was used, with weights of 3/20, 3/4, and 1/10 respectively. 
The parameter γ was individually chosen for each dataset: 0.005 for MovieLens-20M, 0.0035 for Netflix Prize Dataset, and 0.01 for Million Songs Dataset. Each model was trained for N = 50 epochs (N = 100 for MSD) and selected based on the best NDCG@100 score on a validation subset. 
The process began with training a model for MovieLens-20M and then fine-tuned it for Netflix Prize Dataset and MSD. 
Equations:

1. logσ2 = <font color='red'>10</font>
2. γ = 0.005, γ = 0.0035, γ = 0.01
3. N = 50, N = 100

## 4.5 Results

**Results Summary**

The proposed RecVAE model outperforms all previous autoencoder-based models across all three datasets in terms of recommendation quality, particularly with a big improvement over Mult-VAE. The new features of RecVAE and RaCT are independent and can be used together for even higher performance. However, RecVAE only significantly outperforms EASE on the MovieLens-20M dataset, while showing competitive performance on the Netflix Prize Dataset. 
The key takeaways from this study are:

* <font color='red'>RecVAE achieves state-of-the-art performance across all three datasets</font>. * The proposed model's new features can be used independently or in conjunction with RaCT for enhanced performance. * RecVAE outperforms EASE only on the MovieLens-20M dataset, but shows competitive results on the Netflix Prize Dataset.

## 4.6 Ablation study and negative results

Here are the summarized results without modifiers:

We performed an ablation study to investigate the impact of each new feature introduced for RecVAE compared to Mult-VAE on performance improvement. The features included a new encoder architecture, composite prior for latent codes, β rescaling, alternating training, and removing denoising for the decoder. Each new feature indeed improved results, with all proposed new features leading to the best NDCG@100 scores on all three datasets. 
The study showed that some new features are complementary, such as <font color='red'>β rescaling and alternating training</font>, which degrade scores when applied individually but improve them together. The new architecture does not bring much improvement by itself but facilitates other new features. <font color='red'>β rescaling is dataset-sensitive, sometimes improving a lot and sometimes doing virtually nothing</font>. 
We also analyzed the composite prior, finding that it stabilizes training as evidenced by the rate of change in variational parameters. The regularizer fixes the "forgetting" problem, as illustrated in Figure 2. 
Some negative results were also reported: autoencoder-based models for item embeddings did not reach the results of RecVAE, and more complex prior distributions, such as mixtures of Gaussians and VampPrior, collapsed to a single node. However, the RealNVP prior yielded better performance compared to the standard Gaussian prior. 
Finally, we tried re-weighing each term in the decomposed KL divergence separately but neither decomposition led to better results. 
**Important equations:**

\[ NDCG@100 = \sum_{i=1}^{100} (2^{rel_i} - 1) / \log_2(i+1) \]

\[ KL(q(z|x)||p(z)) = D_{KL}(q(z|x)||p(z)) + D_{KL}(q(z|x)||p(z|y)) \]

## 5 CONCLUSION

Here is the summarized result:

We have introduced RecVAE, a model that builds upon Mult-VAE by incorporating <font color='red'>a new encoder architecture</font>, a composite prior distribution for latent codes, <font color='red'>an improved approach to setting the hyperparameter β</font>, and alternating updates of the encoder and decoder. The results show that RecVAE's performance is comparable to EASE and significantly outperforms other models on MovieLens-20M, Netflix Prize Dataset, and Million Songs Dataset. 
Theoretical motivations for these modifications are incomplete, and some ideas have been driven by practical improvements rather than thorough analysis. However, we believe that a comprehensive theoretical study of these concepts could lead to further breakthroughs, making it an essential area for future research. 
RecVAE's performance on classical collaborative filtering datasets demonstrates its effectiveness in this domain. The model's success is attributed to the combination of innovative techniques and careful tuning of hyperparameters.
