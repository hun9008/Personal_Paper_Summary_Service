## 1. INTRODUCTION

**Summary**

In the era of information explosion, recommender systems play a crucial role in alleviating information overload, having been widely adopted by many online services. The key to a personalized recommender system is in modelling users' preference on items based on their past interactions. **One** of the most popular collaborative filtering techniques is matrix factorization (MF), which projects users and items into a shared latent space. 
However, the performance of MF can be hindered by the simple choice of the interaction function - inner product. This paper explores the use of deep neural networks for learning the interaction function from data, rather than relying on handcrafted functions. **The** main contributions of this work are as follows:

* Developing a neural network modelling approach for collaborative filtering
* Focusing on implicit feedback, which is more challenging to utilize due to its noisy and indirect nature
* Exploring the use of deep neural networks to model noisy implicit feedback signals

**Key Contributions**

<font color='red'>The proposed method</font> combines the strengths of matrix factorization and deep neural networks to improve the performance of collaborative filtering. By leveraging the power of DNNs, <font color='red'>the method can learn a more complex interaction function</font>, which is essential for accurately modelling user preferences on items. 
**Methodology**

The proposed method involves two main components: a matrix factorization component and a deep neural network component. The matrix factorization component is used to project users and items into a shared latent space, while the DNN component is used to learn a more complex interaction function that takes into account the noisy and indirect nature of implicit feedback. 
<font color='red'>The key equation for the proposed method</font> can be written as:

$$\hat{y} = \sum_{i=1}^{K} u_i^T v_i + f(u, v)$$

where $\hat{y}$ is the predicted rating, $u_i$ and $v_i$ are the latent vectors of user and item, respectively, and $f(u, v)$ is the learned interaction function.

## 2. PRELIMINARIES

**Problem Formalization**

The problem of collaborative filtering with implicit feedback involves predicting user preferences based on their historical interactions (e.g., clicks, purchases). However, traditional methods often fail to capture complex relationships between users and items. 
<font color='red'>One major limitation is the reliance on inner product in matrix factorization (MF) models</font>. 
**Existing Solutions**

Previous work has focused on modifying the MF model to improve its accuracy. These solutions include:

*   Using alternative norms or distances instead of the standard inner product
*   Introducing additional regularization terms to prevent overfitting

However, these approaches often lead to increased computational complexity and may not generalize well to diverse user behavior. 
**MF Recap**

The widely used MF model represents users and items as vectors in a latent space. By computing the dot product of these vectors, the model predicts the likelihood of an interaction between a user and item. However, this approach is limited by its reliance on inner product, which fails to capture non-linear relationships. 
<font color='red'>To overcome this limitation, we need to develop more sophisticated models that can handle complex interactions</font>.

## 2.1 Learning from Implicit Data

**Content**

Let M and N denote the number of users and items, respectively. We define the user–item interaction matrix Y ∈ RM×N from users’ implicit feedback as, yui = (cid:40)1, if interaction (user u, item i) is observed; 0, otherwise. 
<font color='red'>The value of 1 for yui indicates that there is an interac- tion between user u and item i;</font> however, it does not mean u actually likes i. Similarly, a value of 0 does not necessarily mean u does not like i, it can be that the user is not aware of the item. 
The recommendation problem with implicit feedback is formulated as the problem of estimating the scores of unobserved entries in Y, which are used for ranking the items. Model-based approaches assume that data can be generated (or described) by an underlying model. Formally, they can be abstracted as learning ˆ yui = f(u,i|Θ), where ˆ yui denotes the predicted score of interaction yui. 
To estimate parameters Θ, existing approaches generally follow the machine learning paradigm that optimizes an objective function. Two types of objective functions are most commonly used in literature — pointwise loss [14, 19] and pairwise loss [27, 33]. As a natural extension of abundant work on explicit feedback [21, 46], methods on pointwise learning usually follow a regression framework by minimizing the squared loss between ˆ yui and its target value yui. 
For pairwise learning [27, 44], the idea is that observed entries should be ranked higher than the unobserved ones. As such, instead of minimizing the loss between ˆ yui and yui, pairwise learning maximizes the margin between observed entry ˆ yui and unobserved entry ˆ yuj. 
Moving one step forward, our NCF framework parameterizes the interaction function f using neural networks to estimate ˆ yui. As such, it naturally supports both pointwise and pairwise learning. 

**Mathematical Representation**

$$
\mathbf{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}, \quad y_{ui} = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if interaction (user u, item i) is observed;} \\
0, & \text{otherwise;}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\hat{y}_{ui} = f(u,i|\boldsymbol{\Theta}),
$$

where $\mathbf{Y}$ is the user-item interaction matrix, $y_{ui}$ represents the score of interaction between user u and item i, $\hat{y}_{ui}$ denotes the predicted score of interaction yui, and $\boldsymbol{\Theta}$ denotes model parameters.

## 2.2 Matrix Factorization

**MF Modeling Limitations**

The Matrix Factorization (MF) technique associates each user and item with a real-valued vector of latent features. The estimated interaction between a user and an item is calculated as the inner product of their latent vectors, assuming each dimension is independent and linearly combined with equal weights. This limitation can be illustrated through an example. 
The example highlights that MF may not accurately capture complex interactions due to its use of a simple and fixed inner product function. For instance, if two users have similar preferences, but the new user has different similarities with other users, MF might not correctly predict their similarity. This is because the inner product function can limit expressiveness. 
**Key Takeaways**

<font color='red'>MF assumes each dimension of latent space is independent and linearly combined with equal weights</font>, which may lead to limitations in capturing complex interactions. <font color='red'>A simple and fixed inner product function can limit expressiveness, resulting in incorrect similarity predictions</font>. To address this issue, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) can be used to learn the interaction function from data. 
**Equations**

The estimated interaction between a user and an item is calculated as:
\[ˆ yui = f(u,i|pu,qi) = pT uqi = \sum_{k=1}^K pukqik\]

## 3. NEURAL COLLABORATIVE FILTERING

**General Framework**

We present a general **<font color='red'>Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)</font>** framework, which learns to predict implicit feedback using a probabilistic model that emphasizes its binary nature. This framework provides a foundation for exploring neural networks in collaborative filtering. 
**MF and NCF Connection**

Matrix Factorization (MF) can be expressed and generalized under the NCF framework. This connection enables us to leverage the strengths of MF, such as linearity, while still allowing for non-linear interactions through the use of neural networks. 
**Instantiation with DNNs**

We propose an instantiation of NCF using a **<font color='red'>Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)</font>**, which learns the user-item interaction function. This approach allows us to explore the potential of Deep Neural Networks for collaborative filtering tasks. 
**Unified Model**

A new neural matrix factorization model is presented, which ensembles MF and MLP under the NCF framework. This unified model combines the strengths of linearity and non-linearity for modeling user-item latent structures, leading to improved performance in collaborative filtering tasks. 
## Mathematical Equations

\[
\hat{y} = f(u, i; \theta)
\]

where $\hat{y}$ is the predicted score, $u$ and $i$ are the user and item embeddings respectively, and $\theta$ represents the model parameters.

## 3.1 General Framework

**Summary**

In this paper, we adopt a multi-layer representation to model user-item interactions using neural networks. The input layer consists of two feature vectors for users and items, which can be customized to support various modeling techniques such as context-aware and content-based. To endow the Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) method with probabilistic explanation, we constrain the output in the range of [0,1] using a probabilistic function as the activation function for the output layer. 
We define the likelihood function as the product of the predicted probabilities for observed interactions and 1 minus the predicted probabilities for unobserved interactions. Taking the negative logarithm of this function, we reach the objective function to minimize for NCF methods, which is equivalent to the binary cross-entropy loss or log loss. By employing a probabilistic treatment for NCF, we address recommendation with implicit feedback as a binary classification problem. 
**Key Findings**

* The use of a multi-layer representation can effectively model user-item interactions. * The employment of a probabilistic function as the activation function for the output layer allows for probabilistic explanation in NCF. * The objective function to minimize for NCF methods is equivalent to the binary cross-entropy loss or log loss. * The use of a non-uniform sampling strategy, such as item popularity-biased, might further improve performance but is left as future work. 
**Equations**

\[ f(PTvU u,QTvI i) = φout(φX(...φ2(φ1(PTvU u,QTvI i))...)), \]

\[ p(Y,Y−|P,Q,Θf) = ∏ (u,i)∈Y ˆ yui ∏ (u,j)∈Y− (1 − ˆ yuj), \]

\[ L = − ∑ (u,i)∈Y log ˆ yui − ∑ (u,j)∈Y− log(1 − ˆ yuj) = − ∑ (u,i)∈Y∪Y− yui log ˆ yui + (1 − yui)log(1 − ˆ yui). \]

## 3.2 Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF)

**Interpretation of MF as NCF**
We show how Matrix Factorization (MF) can be interpreted as a special case of our Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) framework. This allows NCF to mimic a large family of factorization models. The user latent vector pu and item latent vector qi are obtained through one-hot encoding of user (item) ID in the input layer. 
**Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF)**
Under the NCF framework, we can easily generalize MF by using a non-linear function for the output layer activation function aout and allowing the edge weights h to be learned from data without uniform constraint. We implement GMF with the sigmoid function as aout and learn h from data with log loss. 
**Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
To address the issue of insufficient interactions between user and item latent features, we propose adding hidden layers on the concatenated vector using a standard MLP to learn the interaction between pu and qi. This design allows for a large level of flexibility and non-linearity to learn the interactions between pu and qi. 
The key contributions of this work are:

* GMF, which generalizes MF by using a non-linear function for the output layer activation function and allowing the edge weights h to be learned from data without uniform constraint. * MLP, which uses hidden layers on the concatenated vector to learn the interaction between user and item latent features. 
These designs can endow the model with a large level of flexibility and non-linearity to learn complex interactions between user and item latent features.

## 3.4 Fusion of GMF and MLP

**Content**

We have developed two instantiations of NCF - GMF and MLP. To improve their performance, we propose a fused model called NeuMF that combines the strengths of both models. The key idea behind NeuMF is to allow GMF and MLP to learn separate embeddings and combine them by concatenating their last hidden layer. 
**Summary**

The proposed NeuMF model is formulated as follows: 
φGMF = pG u (cid:12) qG i , φMLP = aL(WT L(aL−1(...a2(WT 2 (cid:20)pM u qM i (cid:21) + b2)...)) + bL), ˆ yui = σ(hT (cid:20)φGMF φMLP(cid:21))

where pG u and pM u denote the user embedding for GMF and MLP parts, respectively; and similar notations of qG i and qM i for item embeddings. 
**Key Findings**

<font color='red'>The proposed NeuMF model combines the linearity of MF and non-linearity of DNNs for modelling user–item latent structures.</font> The model is able to learn separate embeddings for GMF and MLP, providing more flexibility than a single embedding layer. 

**Equation**
\[
ˆyui = \sigma(h^T (\phi_{GMF} + \phi_{MLP}))
\]

## 3.4.1 Pre-training

**Summary**

Due to the non-convexity of the objective function of NeuMF, gradient-based optimization methods only find locally-optimal solutions. The initialization of deep learning models plays a crucial role in their convergence and performance. Therefore, we propose to initialize NeuMF using pre-trained models of GMF and MLP. 
To achieve this, we first train GMF and MLP with random initializations until convergence. Then, we use their model parameters as the initialization for the corresponding parts of NeuMF's parameters. For the output layer, we concatenate weights of the two models with a weighted average determined by the hyper-parameter α. 
We train GMF and MLP from scratch using Adam, which adapts the learning rate for each parameter. After pre-training the models, we feed their parameters into NeuMF and optimize it with vanilla SGD, as Adam is unsuitable without saving momentum information. 
**Key Points**

* Pre-trained model initialization plays a crucial role in convergence and performance of deep learning models. * Training GMF and MLP from scratch using Adam yields faster convergence than vanilla SGD. * Using pre-trained model parameters to initialize NeuMF's parameters. * Optimizing NeuMF with vanilla SGD after initializing with pre-trained parameters.

## 4. EXPERIMENTS

Here is the summarized content without modifiers:

We conduct experiments to answer three research questions: 

*   Do our proposed NCF methods outperform state-of-the-art implicit collaborative filtering methods **<font color='red'>?RQ1</font>**. *   How does our proposed optimization framework (log loss with negative sampling) work for the recommendation task **<font color='red'>? RQ2</font>**. *   Are deeper layers of hidden units helpful for learning from user–item interaction data **<font color='red'>? RQ3</font>**. 
Experimental settings are presented first, followed by answering the above research questions.

## 4.1 Experimental Settings

Here's the summarized content without modifications:

We experimented with two publicly accessible datasets: MovieLens and Pinterest. The characteristics of these datasets are summarized in Table 1. 
The original data is very large but highly sparse, making it difficult to evaluate collaborative filtering algorithms. We filtered the dataset in a similar way to MovieLens, retaining only users with at least 20 interactions (pins). This resulted in a subset of the data containing 55,187 users and 1,500,809 interactions. 
To evaluate the performance of item recommendation, we adopted the leave-one-out evaluation method, which has been widely used in literature. We held out each user's latest interaction as the test set and utilized the remaining data for training. 
We compared our proposed NCF methods (GMF, MLP, and NeuMF) with several baselines: ItemPop, ItemKNN, BPR, and eALS. We used a fixed learning rate, varying it and reporting the best performance. 

Our proposed methods aim to model the relationship between users and items, so we mainly compare with user–item models. 
We implemented our proposed methods based on Keras and determined hyper-parameters of NCF methods by randomly sampling one interaction for each user as the validation data and tuning hyper-parameters on it. 
The performance of a ranked list is judged by Hit Ratio (HR) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).

## 4.2 Performance Comparison (RQ1)

**Summary**

The performance of HR@10 and NDCG@10 is analyzed with respect to the number of predictive factors. **<font color='red'>NeuMF achieves the best performance on both datasets</font>**, significantly outperforming eALS and BPR by a large margin. The results indicate the high expressiveness of NeuMF by fusing linear MF and non-linear MLP models. Other NCF methods, GMF and MLP, also show strong performance, with GMF consistently improving over BPR. 
The performance of Top-K recommended lists is analyzed, and **<font color='red'>NeuMF demonstrates consistent improvements over other methods</font>** across positions. The results are statistically significant for p < 0.01. Baseline methods, eALS outperforms BPR on MovieLens with about 5.1% relative improvement, while underperforming BPR on Pinterest in terms of NDCG. 
**Key Findings**

* NeuMF achieves the best performance on both datasets. * GMF consistently improves over BPR. * NeuMF demonstrates consistent improvements over other methods across positions. * eALS outperforms BPR on MovieLens with about 5.1% relative improvement, while underperforming BPR on Pinterest in terms of NDCG. 
**Equations**

$$
\begin{aligned}
HR@10 &= \frac{\text{Number of relevant items retrieved at position 10}}{\text{Total number of relevant items}}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
NDCG@10 &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{10} 2^{rel_i}-1}{\log_2(10+1)}
\end{aligned}
$$

## 4.2.1 Utility of Pre-training

**Summary**

The paper compares two versions of NeuMF: one with pre-training and one without. The results show that the NeuMF with pre-training achieves better performance in most cases, especially on MovieLens and Pinterest datasets. **<font color='red'>This demonstrates the effectiveness of our pre-training method for initializing NeuMF.</font>**

The performance improvements of NeuMF with pre-training are 2.2% and 1.1% for MovieLens and Pinterest, respectively. Interestingly, when using a small predictive factor of 8 on MovieLens, the pre-training method performs slightly worse than the non-pre-trained version. 
**Equations and Results**

Let's denote the performance improvement as $\Delta P$. Then, we have:

$$
\Delta P_{MovieLens} = 2.2\%
$$

and 

$$
\Delta P_{Pinterest} = 1.1\%
$$

## 4.3 Log Loss with Negative Sampling (RQ2)

Here are the summarized results without modifiers:

We cast recommendation as a binary classification task and optimized NCF with log loss, which improves recommendation performance over iterations. The most effective updates occur in the first 10 iterations, and more iterations may lead to overfitting, **<font color='red'>resulting in degraded performance</font>**. 
Among three NCF methods (NeuMF, MLP, GMF), NeuMF achieves the lowest training loss and recommendation performance is best. This provides empirical evidence for optimizing log loss for learning from implicit data. Pointwise log loss has a flexible sampling ratio for negative instances, which can be beneficial compared to pairwise objective functions. 
Optimizing NCF with pointwise log loss shows that sampling more negative instances improves performance. For both MovieLens and Pinterest datasets, the optimal sampling ratio is around 3-6. Sampling too aggressively (larger than 7) may hurt performance, **<font color='red'>indicating the need for moderate sampling</font>**. 
Here are the equations written in LaTeX:

$$
\text{log loss} = - \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \cdot \log(p_i) + (1-y_i) \cdot \log(1-p_i)
$$

$$
HR@10 = \frac{\# of correct recommendations @ 10}{total \# of interactions}
$$

## 4.4 Is Deep Learning Helpful? (RQ3)

Here is the summarized content:

The paper investigated using deep network structures for recommendation tasks, focusing on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). The results showed that stacking more layers improves performance, even for models with the same capability. **<font color='red'>This improvement can be attributed to the high non-linearities brought by stacking more non-linear layers.</font>**

The experiment further verified this by trying to stack linear layers instead of non-linear ones. The performance was much worse when using linear layers, indicating that the non-linearity provided by ReLU units is essential for good results. 
The paper also showed that simply concatenating user and item latent vectors without any transformation (i.e., MLP-0) leads to very weak performance, similar to a non-personalized baseline. This confirms the necessity of transforming user-item interactions with hidden layers.

## 5. RELATED WORK

**Content**

Recent attention in recommendation literature is shifting towards implicit data, focusing on the collaborative filtering (CF) task with implicit feedback as an item recommendation problem. The goal is to recommend a short list of items to users, addressing the more practical but challenging problem compared to rating prediction. 
**Key Insights and Methods**

One key insight is to model the missing data, which are ignored by work on explicit feedback. Early work applied uniform weighting strategies, treating all missing data as negative instances or sampling negative instances from missing data. Recently, dedicated models have been proposed to weight missing data, and implicit coordinate descent (iCD) solutions for feature-based factorization models have achieved state-of-the-art performance. 
**Neural Network Approaches**

Autoencoders have become a popular choice for building recommendation systems. The idea of user-based AutoRec is to learn hidden structures that can reconstruct a user's ratings given her historical ratings as inputs. Denoising autoencoders (DAEs) have been applied to learn from intentionally corrupted inputs, while neural autoregressive methods have also been presented. 
**Limitations and Gaps**

Most previous efforts have focused on explicit ratings and modeled the observed data only, failing to learn users' preference from positive-only implicit data. Although some recent works have explored deep learning models for recommendation based on implicit feedback, they primarily used DNNs for modeling auxiliary information, such as textual description of items or acoustic features of musics. 
**Related Work and Motivation**

The work that is most relevant to our study presents a collaborative denoising autoencoder (CDAE) for CF with implicit feedback. However, CDAE applies a linear kernel to model user-item interactions, which may partially explain why using deep layers does not improve performance. Our NCF adopts a two-pathway architecture, modeling user-item interactions with a multi-layer feedforward neural network, allowing it to learn an arbitrary function from the data. 
**Summary**

<font color='red'>Our contribution is to explore DNNs for pure CF systems</font>, showing that they are a promising choice for modeling user-item interactions. We aim to fill the gap in literature by exploring DNNs for this specific problem setting, demonstrating their effectiveness and generalization ability.

## 6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

**Content**

We proposed a general framework NCF (Neural Collaborative Filtering) that serves as a guideline for developing deep learning methods for recommendation. Our framework is simple and generic, allowing it to be used in conjunction with various neural network architectures. 
<font color='red'>The mainstream shallow models for collaborative filtering are complemented by this work, opening up new avenues of research possibilities.</font> In the future, we plan to study pairwise learners for NCF models and extend NCF to model auxiliary information such as user reviews, knowledge bases, and temporal signals. 
<font color='red'>Our goal is to develop personalization models that can handle groups of users, which will aid in decision-making for social groups.</font> Additionally, we are interested in building recommender systems for multi-media items, which contain richer visual semantics that can reflect users' interests. To achieve this, we need to develop effective methods to learn from multi-view and multi-modal data.
